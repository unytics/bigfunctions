    Technologies make roles change.¬†

    Since the rise of cloud data-warehouses and the birth of dbt, data engineers don‚Äôt do data transform anymore. SQL speaking people do: the analytics engineers.

    With the rise of generative AI, analytics engineers may build data-apps too.

    This is the reasoning of Marcus with who I got a great conversation last week.


    It resonated with my own convictions.

    But while Marcus was thinking of analytics engineers making streamlit apps, I think there is space again for SQL.

    Evidence  tagline ‚ÄúBuild polished data apps with SQL‚Äù goes exactly in that direction. Archie‚Äôs team is inspiring.


    In 2025, I hope to make my own contribution with a data-apps framework - for data activation - made for SQL users.

    If you‚Äôre interested in data-apps too, leave me a message, I‚Äôd love to have a chat!


    What‚Äôs your take on this?

    Will SQL users build data-apps?

    What for?

    üëâ  To me, Timo Dechau creates some of the best content about Product Analytics.

    I've been following him for two years now, and he's forged my convictions about event data.


    Don't know Timo yet?

    Read this:

    Luckily, I had just recorded a hands-on session with Paul Marcombes about BigFunctions. And we discussed exactly this use case and did a quick demo. So I got it up and running in just 5 minutes.

    I just published an introduction to BigFunctions (blog and video) - an open-source project that enables analysts to automate data workflows directly from SQL.

    Key takeaways:
    - Deploy pre-built functions in 5 minutes to GCP
    - Send data-driven notifications to Slack
    - Enrich data with API responses and AI without engineering support
    - Seamless integration with dbt

    The best part? It's all SQL-native. No infrastructure management needed.

    His article, "Beyond SQL as a Pure Database Syntax," really captures what we're trying to achieve.

    I'm happy with this article because it highlights:

    ‚Ä¢  SQL's limitations for complex analytics.
    ‚Ä¢  How BigFunctions improves reusability and workflow by bringing functionality and composability to SQL.
    ‚Ä¢  How it supports a separation of concerns for data teams.

    But I recently realized that SQL's syntax isn't the real problem. The core issue lies in its underlying semantics ‚Äì how we actually interact with and understand our data

    In tech (and in general), semantics often struggles to keep pace with syntax. In my latest blog post, I explore how modern tooling like Unytics BigFunctions help to bridge this crucial gap between SQL's origins and modern analytics needs

    üîπ 2024
    In 2024, I built 4 Open-Source Data Apps:

    -  bigfunctions
    -  airbyte-serverless
    -  catalog-builder
    -  data-api

    They got thousands of users and I often received nice messages. I must admit it's quite satisfying ü§ó . Thanks everyone.


    üîπ 2025
    In 2025, I want to accelerate.
    I'd love to make a living of building Data Apps.


    üëâ If you're thinking of activating data from your data-platform to generate value, I'd love to have a chat.

    I am looking for new ideas and would be happy to share mine.

    I had a great talk this morning with Burak, CEO of Bruin at¬†DATANOSCO podcast from St√©phane.


    Burak shared his vision to bring an all-in-one data-platform through bruin.

    Here are key elements:

    1/ NO no-code!¬†
    Bruin is code and configuration-based first. It's built around standards to fasten development. It makes it versionable in git and easily extensible.

    2/ All-in-one changes everything
    Bruin can provide templates to get started loading some data from a specific source up to making the data transforms in a opinionated way. If you had to mix different tools, the user experience would be much less fluid. What's more, this considerably reduces the amount of gluing required for data engineers.

    3/ Built on open-source
    Bruin team created ingestr, a wrapper above dlt from dltHub to ingest data from any data-warehouse. Building above top open-source data tools makes bruin benefits from the data-community to get fast and on top. Giving back to open-source is part of the deal.


    Thanks a lot St√©phane for the invitation to your podcast! Burak, I will be follow what you build with attention!

    1/ Modern-Data-Stack limitations
    Modern-data-stack brought data tooling for any data service:

    - Fivetran for ingestion.
    - dbt Labs for transform.
    - Hightouch for activation.
    - Prefect for orchestration
    - SYNQ for reliability
    - CastorDoc for catalog

    This has been seen as a revolution.
    Whatever your need, there's a tool for it.

    BUT is also led to a common criticism.

    üëâ You still need to choose, understand, buy and manage all of these tools from different vendors. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


    2/ Hello all-in-one data-platforms
    That's when all-in-one data-platforms came in.
    Y42 brings a one-stop-shop for companies to handle their data-platforms.

    Problem solved!

    BUT, y42 only runs inside y42.

    üëâ Hello vendor lock-in. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


    3/ Bruin: the new player in the game
    That's when Bruin entered the game.

    They provide a all-in-one data-platform with ingestion, SQL transform, python jobs (for custom load, transform or activation), and orchestration.

    It works locally, it's mostly open-source, and you can run it everywhere.

    Did I mention it also comes with a VS code extension to streamline development?

    I am impressed about what they built in a year.


    Do you share my enthusiasm? Why not?

    I started working 13 years ago in medical imaging.
    We were 5 people in the company.
    We built ultrasound scanners from end to end.
    I was impressed by our speed compared to our competitors.

    It was because we were small.
    Us, engineers, were in direct contact with doctors.
    We were able to discover their problems in the morning and ship solutions in the afternoon.

    At that time I thought that competitors with hundreds of employees were unlucky.
    They would never be as fast as us.
    Their flow from idea to delivery contained too numerous asphixying steps.

    This was before I came to Nickel.


    üëâ At Nickel, I realized that you can be 900 employees and still be fast.

    One way is to get autonomous teams
    while respecting big companies requirements.

    One key for this is to create a FRAMEWORK which:

    ‚úÖ¬†is a space of trust in which teams can make their own decisions.
    ‚úÖ¬†defines guidelines and standards (security, compliance, brand, etc.).
    ‚úÖ¬†defines boundaries that limit teams inter-dependencies.
    ‚úÖ¬†comes with platform tools & platform teams to go faster while harmonizing the work.


    For example:

    ‚ùå BAD ‚ûú teams depend on CENTRAL BOTTLENECK committees for validation of everything. Even minor initiatives.

    ‚úÖ¬†GOOD ‚ûú security team gives you the autonomy to build stuff while helping you to follow cybersecurity standards.

    üëâ AVOID bottlenecks & EMPOWER people within a FRAMEWORK.


    I may give details of how we did for Nickel data people in a next post.
    Stay tuned.


    I wish you a Happy New Year!

    BigFunctions lets you use Python functions directly in BigQuery, and thanks to its prebuilt functions, you can even run LLMs through SQL. It‚Äôs a great way to extend BigQuery‚Äôs capabilities without needing external tools.

    In my case, I wanted to quickly get foundational details (country, city, and year of establishment) for some well-known football teams. Using the ask_ai function, I was able to send a simple prompt, get structured responses, and parse them‚Äîall within BigQuery.

    This is just one example, but there‚Äôs a lot more you can do with it. It‚Äôs a practical tool that simplifies working with AI and Python in a SQL environment.
    Big thanks to Paul for building and sharing this!

    Static BI is about creating interactive dashboards on top of Parquet files.

    It's trending since we can run duckdb in the browser.

    If you follow this area, you already know Observable and Evidence tools.


    But I am pretty sure you don't know mozaic yet.


    ‚ûú Mozaic Dashboards are interactive, fast, based on parquet files and they can deal with a lot of data.

    ‚ûú What make them great in my opinion is that you can generate them on the fly using a simple yaml configuration AND with vanilla javascript.

    NO MORE front-end build or deployment needed!


    This opens a wide new area for static BI.

    In the example of the screenshot, I am downloading a YAML configuration file from another website and generating the dashboard on the fly with it!

    It means that we can share YAML configurations templates for common dashboards on common analyses üò≤.

    The example is in the comment. Don't hesitate to play with it. It's fun.


    In your opinion, is there a place for static BI?
    What would you use it for?

    I often need to get the Net Promoter Score from customer surveys.


    The formula is "% promoters - % detractors".

    It's not very complex.

    I could re-write this formula each time.


    But as an engineer,

    I really prefer to put this logic in a function.

    And re-use this function everywhere.


    How do you do it on your side?

    Both tools are used by millions of developers everyday to deploy their documentation website.

    Which one to choose?


    ‚ûú  It depends if your a pythonist or a front end engineer.


    With docusaurus you can mix mardown with react components. It brings huge possibilities in an elegant mannner.

    But if you‚Äôre not a front end engineer but a pythonist you will find docusaurus over complicated and would rather stick with mkdocs (using Mkdocs material or readthedoc themes).



    ‚òù I feel the same for bi as code tools.

    Observable and evidence.dev look absolutely awesome to me.

    But as a pythonist I think we can do simpler.

    I am even considering making bi as code  with a simple mkdocs plugin.

    Would you be interested?

    Am I wrong with the above thoughts?

    Modern Data Stack have tools to do everything with data.

    Everything EXCEPT custom stuff.

    ‚ûú you end up with a ton of python scripts floating around.


    Kestra aims to solve this.

    They propose a central tool to orchestrate your jobs in a declarative way.


    We propose ANOTHER way.

    We propose you simply use dbt instead (or sqlmesh or dataform).

    It means all your jobs must be callable from SQL.

    Which is easy nowadays.

    As data-warehouses natively do python callable from SQL.


    What if you could easily build :

    -  a catalog
    -  of advanced functions
    -  callable by anyone from SQL
    -  & defined in a declarative manner

    ?


    Say hi to the SQL Declarative-Data-Stack!


    What's your opinion on this?

    Would you be ready to do everything from SQL?

    If not, Why?

    I'm thinking something like this (images attached). The "engine" is basically only transpiling from config to the actual data stack with multiple adapters‚Äî e.g., dbt, SDF, SQLMesh for `transform()`.

    I can't help but think about DWH Automation (DWA).

    > Config = template
    > Engine = DWA
    > DDS = generated SQLs

    If you were to implement a declarative data stack engine (DDSE), would you focus on the *one-time* generation of a data stack (second image attached) or the continuous update?

    What I mean is, would you fix or update configs/templates as DWA did or the artifacts (SQL, YAMLs) without touching the generated code?

    Any thoughts? ü§î Gregor Zeiler, Jan Kaul, Matthew Kosovec and others in my network?

    If your microservices could consume your dbt models with low latency, you'd unlock great use cases:

    ‚á®  content personalization
    ‚á®  embedded analytics
    ‚á®  feature flipping
    ‚á®  feature store
    ‚á®  etc


    These slides demonstrate how analytics-engineers can expose their dbt models as API endpoints with one line in dbt.

    (they are a re-work from our presentation at API Days with Hachem LATRACH yesterday).

    Looking forward to reading your comments.

    What is your use cases for consuming a low-latency api on dbt models data?

    This morning with Hachem LATRACH from Nickel  we were at API Days Paris.

    We explained several use cases where YOU WANT to expose your dbt models as an api.


    We demonstrated how you can build a:

    -  scalable (millions of requests / s),
    -  serverless,
    -  low latency (milliseconds)

    data-api on top of dbt models by a simple sql line in dbt configuration.

    Interested?

    Add a comment and if we get enough we will post our slides.

    But there is even more. BigFunctions by Unytics offers even more extremely convenient ways to bring data into BigQuery. For example, it is now possible to ingest GoogleTrends data through the API with a simple function call:

    select bigfunctions.eu.get_google_trends('bigquery', null, 'today 5-y', null, null)
    ü§© üöÄ

    Sure, the output will need to be unpacked with JSON / array functions, but still, a good few hours or days can be saved especially if you don‚Äôt have data engineering resources at your disposal.

    Google Trends data can be useful for many reasons, but one can be to check the overall ‚Äúglobal‚Äù trends of keywords when a website‚Äôs organic traffic shows a significant decline for these keywords. Checking what‚Äôs going on ‚Äúoutside‚Äù the SearchConsole data can help troubleshoot whether we‚Äôre dealing with an SEO issue or a decline in interest (i.e. an economical situation).

    This is not an affiliate post. It‚Äôs a happy user & fan post. BigFunctions is just soo handy, and free, with many functions ready to use in BigQuery without any setup or ‚Äúinstallation‚Äù. (Thanks Paul Marcombes)

    Enjoy and leverage Google Trends data!

    Sherloq is a tool to organize and share your SQL queries.

    What caught my eye is the UX:

    >  It feels like an integral part of your data warehouse console.
    >  (thanks to a browser extension).


    I could not wait to build my own chrome extension.


    It‚Äôs fun because I started BigFunctions two years ago by making visualizations in BigQuery console.

    But it was hacky (inspect the page and inject JavaScript) and I could not find an elegant way.

    I think I just did.

    We often talk about self-service analytics.

    It‚Äôs a way to democratize data access in a company. It focuses on all people.

    But we forget to think about self-service for data-analysts.

    Company people used to be dependent on data-analysts to access data. Self-service analytics changed that.

    Data-analysts are still dependent on data-engineers to do their job. Self-service for data-analysts change that.

    What if data engineers became data-platform engineers, building a catalog of tools that the data-analysts could pick to achieve their job?

    Self-served data-analysts would not be dependent anymore.

    It would open much more scalability to answer data needs.

    It would foster creativity.

    It would boost data activation.


    What‚Äôs your opinion on this?

    BigFunctions was built to reach self-served data analysts. It provides them a catalog of services to do everything they need from SQL.

    Text to SQL is great as a coding assistant for Data Analysts.

    But it won‚Äôt help for business people to get trusted data answers.


    The problem is that SQL can be quite complex. The LLM has too much freedom. It can generate incorrect stuff too easily.

    It‚Äôs OK for a coding assistant. The data analyst will fix it and iterate. It is not acceptable for a CEO.

    You have to constrain stuff.


    We can make the LLM generate requests on a semantic layer instead of SQL.


    Another way would be to have a set of templated queries with parameters.

    The LLM would choose among the templates and guess the correct parameter values.

    For example:

    - A template sql query could be the select of an aggregate of a metric over time with a breakdown on a dimension.

    - Parameters would be the table name, the aggregate function, the metric and the dimension.


    Thanks David Jayatillake  & Naim Kosayyer for opening my eyes on this at Forward Data Conference.

    - functions are deployed in yaml
    - dbt models are declared in yaml/sql.

    2/
    - functions are tested and deployed with a command line.
    - dbt models are tested and deployed with a command line.

    3/
    - in both frameworks the command line generates a documentation website.


    > With dbt and bigfunctions you can then build a all-in-one data-platform as a declarative data stack.


    Thanks Christophe Blefari, Hyma√Øa and Modern Data Network for having me at this great forward data conference.

    1. I am father of 3 children of age 3, 8 and 10.

    2. I started gymnastics 2 months ago. It feels like die and retry. It‚Äôs fun.

    3. I lived one year in China. I worked in a machine learning research lab. It felt like pressing the pause button.

    4. I need to escape one weekend a year. I take a night train. With my bike. And I ride for 48h.

    5. My dream is to build data apps, quit my job and make a living from it.

    At Nickel, we've built a configurable data engine:

    ‚úÖ that allows data analysts to deploy algorithms
    ‚úÖ in batch or real time
    ‚úÖ configured in SQL

    on a wide range of use cases:

    üëâ real-time communications (sms, push, email, etc).
    üëâ fight against financial crime
    üëâ content personalization
    üëâ reversal of functionalities
    üëâ etc.


    Do NOT deploy Algorithms!
    ‚Äî> Deploy configurable platforms!
    Your impact will be 10x



    Delighted to have been able to talk about it on iziday‚Äôs Boris Fievet  mic.

    I bet for sqlmesh.


    Simply because sqlmesh paid product does not compete with their open-source product. It‚Äôs complementary.

    While dbt has little interest in improving dbt-core, sqlmesh, as a challenger, has to be much better to be adopted.

    Actually sqlmesh is already in the lead when it comes to developer experience, and it is just the beginning.

    Go go go Tobias (Toby) Mao and Tobiko !

    üöÄ Paul Marcombes, Head of Data de Nickel, pr√©sente comment l'entreprise utilise l'IA pour am√©liorer l‚Äôexp√©rience client et les processus internes.

    Il pr√©sente comment Nickel associe moteurs de recherche et g√©n√©ration de contenu pour cr√©er des solutions IA adapt√©es.

    Son message essentiel: Bien s√©parer la partie moteur de recherche de la partie g√©n√©ration de contenu. Les utilisateurs veulent voir la vraie data !

    Avec ce retour d'exp√©rience, Paul met en avant une solution simple permettant aux utilisateurs de questionner les retours des clients sur des plateformes comme l‚ÄôApp Store ou Trustpilot via du RAG et de la recherche hybride, adapt√©es √† la gestion rapide et efficace des informations pour les √©quipes.

    Nickel compte aujourd'hui 4 millions de comptes ouverts en 10 ans, une pr√©sence dans 5 pays et 11 000 points partenaires en Europe. L'entreprise a 200 utilisateurs SQL qui exploitent les insights des donn√©es.

    The easiest way to get a holistic view of your text data is to categorize it.

    You'll instantly get:

    ‚ûú the main topics,
    ‚ûú the number of texts associated to each,
    ‚ûú the evolution of these metrics over time


    Here's an example of how I've categorized our user reviews at Nickel.
    I'm impressed by the results.


    It can also be applied to customer support tickets.

    It can also be applied to the Information schema of your database to get a business classification of your tables.

    What other use cases do you see?

    All BI teams are working hard to enable users to get insights from natural language questions.

    Looker Studio is no exception.¬†Here's what I learnt trying their new Conversational Analytics UI:


    Getting better!
    ‚û°Ô∏è  It works great to explore a table
    ‚û°Ô∏è  How was this calculated? exposes very clearly how AI provided the answer and quikly gives you trust in the answer.
    ‚û°Ô∏è  Insights exposes result interpretation in natural language which is great to copy paste in a presentation
    ‚û°Ô∏è  Questions Suggestions are interested to get started
    ‚û°Ô∏è  Suggestions for reformulation work very well


    There's still a lot to do
    ‚û°Ô∏è  Charts are limited. I found no way for the Agent to result a chart showing the evolution of a metric with a break down on a dimension. Quite restricting for an analysis...
    ‚û°Ô∏è  Agent can give you a precise information contained in the table. But forget about asking advanced stuff such as making a feature impact analysis or compare distribution of a metric between two periods.
    ‚û°Ô∏è  Actually it can only answer one unique result at a time. You cannot generate multiple charts at once with analysis by different dimensions.


    Should I use Looker Studio Conversational Analytics?
    ‚û°Ô∏è  I think it is already an interesting tool to expose some prepared data to end users who are not proficient in SQL nor dashboarding
    ‚û°Ô∏è  But if you're a data analyst you would prefer to use BigQuery Canvas which enables to tune your queries and better manage the flow between questions & answers.


    Should I look for other tools?
    The improvement of these tools to enable advanced analysis use cases is just a matter of time. You should definitely keep an eye on what's coming to be ready when it comes.

    I won't we surprised if open-source wins.

    If you're more from engineering here are two tools you want to have a look at:
    - Lida from Microsoft to automate charts from data.
    - opendataqna from Google to query your database in natural language.


    What's you plan in your company?

    You can be the greatest data-analyst, you will never be able to uncover an insight for which you don't have the data.

    Structured data is great: it shows you facts and correlations between phenomena that characterize your product's current situation.

    But you're missing out a ton.

    You can't see what your users are thinking, what they want, what frustrates them.


    I think data analysts should incorporate the ‚Äúvoice of the customer‚Äù into their data and take their data analysis to a new level.


    I'll be explaining how to do this in practice at a conference at the Salon Data IA in Nantes, France.

    Retrieval Augmented Generation is one of the best way to get started with GenAI in a company.

    Mathilde Gorieu made us realize at Nickel that while it's very powerful to help people find information from a knowledge base, it does not always offer the best user experience with regard to the use case.

    So instead of embedding a hidden search engine into your RAG system, it's better to decouple search and RAG and offer a User Experience with both functionalities.

    With Mathilde Gorieu we're going to share today what we've learned at Nickel while implementing several RAG use cases.

    We believe that search and RAG are complementary and search should not be hidden inside the RAG.

    Data engineers, are you tired of manually building and managing BigQuery functions?¬†
    BigFunctions is revolutionizing your workflow!

    üí°Created by data guru Paul Marcombes, the open-source project BigFunctions offers¬†100+ functions ready to implement for your BigQuery projects.

    The most common BigFunctions use cases are:

    ‚Ä¢ Expand functionality. Despite the array of functions available in BigQuery, there might be occasions where a specific function is needed but not included.
    ‚Ä¢ Streamline your queries: UDFs act like reusable code snippets in BigQuery. Instead of rewriting the same complicated calculations over and over, define them once as a UDF and then simply reference them wherever needed.
    ‚Ä¢ Standardization. UDFs act like a playbook for your queries. By creating a UDF for a particular calculation, you ensure everyone is using the same definition, promoting consistency across large teams or complex organizations.

    Check out BigFunctions and what it help you do in our article (link in the comments)

    dbt provides post-hooks.

    Post-hooks are SQL queries that run after model creation.

    Refresh_tableau is a function available to anyone in BigQuery to trigger the refresh of a Tableau source with SQL.

    One can then refresh a Tableau Workbook at the minute its dbt model is re-computed, thanks to a dbt post-hook.

    Many Thanks Antoine Giraud for having created this function in BigFunctions

    3. You should say NO to more stuff
    4. You have to say NO to more stuff
    5. You will fail if you don't say NO to more stuff

    Everyone thinks they need to please everyone when they take on a role in data.

    In reality, you need to get really great at saying NO to low-value requests.

    Otherwise, your team will be a low-value team.

    __

    As a data leader this is your most important job.

    Find the high-value stuff, and say NO to everything else.

    Airbyte built awesome open-source connectors to move data into your warehouse.


    What if we could run them via a simple SQL query?


    That's what this function does. You can get data from any public GitHub Repo into your BigQuery project (no install required). It uses Airbyte Github connector under the hood.

    This could work for any Airbyte python connectors.

    Imagine that all you needed was an SQL query to obtain data from any source üò≤

    Which source should we prioritize?

    I like this article from Jake Holmquist ‚òÅÔ∏è as it describes the two sides of bigfunctions:

    ‚û°Ô∏è¬†Effortless access to advanced BigQuery functions:¬†No installation. Just new SQL power at your fingertips. ü§Ø

    ‚û°Ô∏è¬†Build your own governed function catalog:¬†Empower your team with a centralized, secure, and reusable function library. üèóÔ∏è


    While the first side is well-known, I am not sure about the second one.

    Yet the benefits of building a catalog of functions with BigFunctions are many:

    ‚úÖ¬† Give new power to Data Analysts such as calling your company APIs
    ‚úÖ¬† Promote consistency with a standard to define functions
    ‚úÖ¬† Enable discoverability with a searchable web catalog
    ‚úÖ¬† Use software engineering best practices

    Thanks to remote functions, you can get data from any website into BigQuery with a simple SQL query ü§ó

    Here is an example to:

    ‚úÖ  Download user reviews of Nickel App from App Store.
    ‚úÖ  Translate them into English
    ‚úÖ  You can then use GenAI functions & get actionable insights!


    Functions are already available without install in your GCP project.

    Airbyte (the leading open-source solution to move your data to your data-warehouse) finally released their connectors as python packages. They even released a package (PyAirbyte) to easily use them from python.

    This is great news as:

    ‚úÖ  PyAirbyte is standalone: you don't need to install and run an airbyte server anymore!
    ‚úÖ  Python practitioners only need to write < 10 line of code to move data from any source to the data-warehouse
    ‚úÖ  Deployment can be done easily on serverless compute such as Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Cloud Run Jobs, Lambda functions, etc.


    I created AirbyteServerless last year to solve these exact problems and I am very happy that Airbyte could take some inspiration of it to offer an even better solution. Great work Aaron ("AJ") Steers ! üëè üéâ

    Embed data-people in teams to scale

    One way to scale data analysis is to embed data people in teams, tribes, domains. You give them the autonomy on the whole data chain including transforms.

    Because teams are autonomous to collect data, transform it and expose it to others, you avoid the bottleneck of depending on a central data-team for these tasks. It then gets easier to scale.


    But doing so, you create a risk.

    Data people in teams could come to work differently, with different tools. This can lead to silos with less shareable knowledge. It may become hard to maintain and not optimal.


    One way to solve that is to build data guilds

    Guilds are communities of data people with shared interests such as analytics engineering to share knowledge, tools code and practices.

    While guilds are great you may want to have people working full time to improve practices.


    The Staff Analytics Engineer Role

    We had a great talk last week from Martin Lang et Dimitri Antakly from Decathlon Digital who introduced their role: Staff Analytics Engineer.


    The Staff Analytics-Engineer is in the central data team and:

    ‚úÖ  Takes a step back to improve the analytics engineering practices
    ‚úÖ  Animates the community of data-people working on transforms
    ‚úÖ  Helps data-people and Provides guidelines
    ‚úÖ  Tests new tools

    Martin and Dimitri gave a great example of their added value:

    They identified a problem of re-work between tribes and they (with the community) decided to create a shared dbt zone with shared transforms between the sources and the tribes transforms.


    üôè Martin and Dimitri for this very inspiring talk.
    üôè St√©phane Heckel from DATANOSCO for organizing this great Modern-Data Stack conference

  text: |
    We had a great presentation from Tangi Gouez and Manuel Cellier from Dashlane last week at Nickel. They told us their tips to take the most of data-analysts in an organization:

    üí¨ "They must deliver actionable insights at the right moment to generate value".


    üí¨ "They should NOT start a data-analysis before knowing the actions that will be taken once done.


    A key-factor of failure for data-analysts üìâ
    While these tips are great and inspirational, they highlight a key-factor of failure for data-analysts:

    "If you deliver a great insight but the product/development team is not ready to develop the recommended changes, all your data-analysis work is lost and you bring no value" üòæ.



    What if data-analysts could take the actions themselves? üí°

    At Nickel, when the team works on "out of stock" issues at points of sale, the data-analyst can, on his own:
    - analyse the problem, quantify the lost value and decide to take actions,
    - build a ML model to predict if a point of sale is "out of stock soon",
    - automatically order some material when "out of stock soon" is predicted.

    No data-engineers need to be involved nor product/development team.

    This is, we believe, how you make your data-analysts impactful:

    üèÜ  "You give them the power to take the actions themselves" üèÜ



    How to do this in your company too? üöÄ

    Your company probably built micro-services exposed in a catalog of apis (with one route to order material for one point of sale). What you need is to make these apis available to your data-warehouse.

    That's exactly the purpose of BigFunctions: to build a catalog of advanced functions callable by data-analysts from your data-warehouse. The functions can call your company internal apis or public ones for your saas products.

    Querying your BigQuery data in SQL is very natural and efficient but you want to use BigQuery Dataframes (aka Bigframes) if:

    ‚úÖ  You come from the pandas world.
    ‚úÖ  Your sql becomes too verbose and hard to maintain and you want to group code in functions or to reuse code.
    ‚úÖ  You want to write scripts as it is much easier to develop python scripts than stored procedures.

    üì¢ Announcement
    Every BigFunction (to do advanced transforms) is directly available from BigQuery Dataframes (no install needed!)

    Every data project starts with moving data from different sources to your data-warehouse for analysis. To this end, Airbyte certainly provides the best open-source product with 300+ source connectors and a huge communityüëÄ.

    I created a lightweight python package (airbyte-serverless) to manage these connectors in the yaml era and I felt really honored when Modeo contacted me to showcase it to the world during a webinar. üß°

    What surprised me is that Modeo went further than I anticipated as they used airbyte-serverless to run their own custom connectors. üí™

    It was a real pleasure to meet you Ismael Goulani Lynn Farhat Matthieu Rousseau and build stuff together. I have been impressed by your teamwork actually.  üôå

    ‚úÖ  Move data with Airbyte Serverless
    ‚úÖ  Transform it with dbt
    ‚úÖ  Orchestrate with Google Workflows


    Airbyte is certainly the most advanced open-source system to move your data from any source to your data-warehouse.

    But deploying Airbyte Core to manage connectors can be a hassle if you're not a Kubernetes expert.

    That's why I created Airbyte-Serverless.

    I am kind of proud that Lynn Farhat and Ismael Goulani from Modeo are organizing a live demo to showcase how they use it in production for their clients.

    Register here for the online event: https://lnkd.in/dnxbYGhC

    Airbyte-Serverless GitHub: https://lnkd.in/eYKPJtey

    Feel free to leave a ‚≠ê on the GitHub repo ü§ó

    Execute this query in your BigQuery :

    select bigfunctions.eu.phone_number_info('+33123456789', null)

    and you'll get:

    ‚úÖ  if the phone number is valid
    ‚úÖ  its country
    ‚úÖ  its type: fixed or mobile

    Data catalog is key for your data-mesh strategy. Why building vs buying?

    I was at a (great) c2c event last night and I realized two things:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Without a good catalog, your data-mesh strategy will be a failure as your useful and trusted data won‚Äôt be discoverable.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ While there are many great vendors on this space, some companies keep building their own tool instead of buying.

    - ADEO (Leroy Merlin+) built its data-finder
    - Carrefour built its data-supermarket
    - LinkedIn built Data-Hub
    - Lyft built Amundsen
    And the list goes on.


    Why?


    At Nickel, we also decided to build instead of buy. As an entry point of your data, your catalog can become much more than listing assets. And vendors won‚Äôt be able to suit the specific needs of your business or your tooling.

    Actually even two of our most basic needs were not always considered:

    1Ô∏è‚É£  Search results MUST be sorted by popularity. (And by popularity I mean usage, not an edited popularity on the catalog by some stewards via promotion or "thumb up").  When I type Àãcustomer` in my portal I have a hundred results. The most used table MUST be on top.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ We use looker studio as BI tool, but most of the time, there‚Äôs no connector to it. Btw, I really don‚Äôt want to have all company dashboards here, only curated super dashboards with their metadata.


    I‚Äôd love to know what you think. Do you build or buy your data-catalog? Why?

    When it comes to ùó±ùó≤ùóΩùóπùóºùòÜ Airbyte you have several options:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ use Airbyte Cloud if you want a managed service
    2Ô∏è‚É£ deploy on an instance (quite easy but not robust)
    3Ô∏è‚É£ deploy on kubernetes (hard except if you already have a cluster running).

    This leaves you no choice if you‚Äôre a serverless aficionado who likes managed services but likes deploying yourself. üßê

    Airbyte Serverless:

    ‚ùå has NO database
    ‚ùå has NO transform layer

    Airbyte Serverless:
    ‚úÖ is run from a CLI
    ‚úÖ is based of yaml files on git
    ‚úÖ can run on serverless compute

    You‚Äôll then have a robust and scalable solution at unbeatable cost with all benefits of cloud native serverless architectures.

    ‚Ä¶ how do you want people to find the information they need from this overcrowded space üßê?


    At Nickel, since we had "only one" dashboard per domain, we skyrocketed data discovery at the company. üöÄ

    We call them super-dashboards (ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) like our very few and large data-warehouse super-tables (ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) which ease table discovery a lot. üëÄ



    Having a unique super-dashboard for each domain:

    ‚úÖ eases dramatically information discovery
    ‚úÖ then reduces significantly the data questions you receive
    ‚úÖ helps you to consider it as a product and to focus on building a community of users to collect needs and improve it constantly (while striving to keep it light and well organized).


    Having a dedicated chat channel referenced in the dashboard is not a bad idea to collect feedback and make announcements. (üëèCl√©ment Pierson).



    Thanks Ethan Aaron  for your yesterday post which recalled me this: https://lnkd.in/eGA73qwB

    The best data is the data you don‚Äôt store!

    - I just deleted 3433 tables.
    - And I instantly felt way better. ü§ó
    - Wanted to share the feeling. üòÅ


    We should NOT keep data for 10 years for analytics purposes!
    it's time to vacuum ‚ú®!


    Then:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ You won't pay for storage
    2Ô∏è‚É£ You'll pay much less for querying
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Your queries will be more efficient ¬†
    4Ô∏è‚É£ You'll find your useful data more easily



    For this, the most effective are:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Partition expiration üßπ
    - Our biggest table at Nickel represented 30 % of our total storage.
    - It happened that sometimes we had to fully rebuild downstream models. That hurt!
    - We felt better when we put a 120 days partition expiration on it.
    - I am sure you also have low hanging fruits.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ Table expiration on Temp datasets ‚ôªÔ∏è

    3Ô∏è‚É£ Drop tables you don‚Äôt read anymore ‚ú®
    üëâ This is where the 3433 tables I just deleted came from üëÄ
    (If it is not clear how to do I can explain in comments)

    At Nickel, as dbt jobs costs kept rising we decided to take action. ‚òùÔ∏è

    This is when the great R√©mi BENOIST  decided to gamify the thing and created our "dbt cost killing championship"! üèÜ


    Thanks to his natural enthusiasm, periodic tips and the way he kept instilling rythm in the competition, it has been a tremendous success.

    After a quarter we had reduced our dbt run costs by 30%, had a lot of fun, and our 30 dbt contributors had reached a new level of cost awareness. üí™üöÄ


    It was only weeks after the awards ceremony that one of us walked into the office and said out loud:

    "Wait, speaking of dbt, don‚Äôt dbt tests cost money?"

    The championship focused on dbt models run and looked no further.

    A few minutes later one replied:

    "Well hhmmm, indeed‚Ä¶ dbt tests represent half of our total dbt costs" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí•



    In a single day, we could dramatically reduce dbt costs for by applying a new strategy to our testing: do not test everything everyday! Test more often the sources, less often the results of the transformations.

    We learnt a lot of lessons that day.

    If you need to remember one:
    Beware of your dbt tests costs!!! ü§ë

    If you are into reducing BigQuery costs you may have already explored:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ partitioning your tables
    2Ô∏è‚É£ requiring a partition filter on these tables
    3Ô∏è‚É£ clustering your tables


    BUT have you already explored SEARCH INDEX üßê ?


    As you know, BigQuery is NOT designed to find one row in a fat table as:
    - it will scan the entire table to find that row.
    - it will be very expensive
    - and very slow.

    BUT sometimes you really need this use case.
    You have worked hard to consolidate a 360¬∞ view of your customers and you want to expose a dashboard to your customer care deparment so that they can look for one particular customer at a time.

    SEARCH INDEX enables you to do exactly this:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a search index on customer_id column of your table
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Use SEARCH bigquery function to look for the data of one customer_id.


    Now I can keep this use case for less than the cost of a cup of coffee! ‚òï


    Details here: https://lnkd.in/ez2yBpfT
    and there https://lnkd.in/eXHtWXqB

    What's more, Google is expanding indexes use cases dramatically. Read this blog post! https://lnkd.in/egHEtakw

    It makes no sense to waste effort building a 360¬∞ Customer View several times over with several tools. üßê

    That's how Composable CDP were born!

    You already have a 360¬∞ view of your customer in your Data-Warehouse. Use it instead of duplicating your data again! Composable CDP are products built on top of your data-warehouse to activate its data to downstreams tools.


    But today, more and more products announce to be data-warehouse-connected üîå.


    1Ô∏è‚É£ Salesforce is now connected to your data-warehouse
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Mixpanel is now connected to your data-warehouse


    Are Composable CDP dead üßõ?

    What do you think?

    A √©couter sur la plage ou au bord de la piscine sans mod√©ration.

    Je retiens de cette discussion avec Christophe Blefari  et Pierre de Poulpiquet :


    1Ô∏è‚É£ L‚Äôautonomie peut amener au chaos si chacun fait des choses dans son coin, avec des donn√©es diff√©rentes, des d√©finitions diff√©rentes, des outils diff√©rents.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ Il semble essentiel de structurer l‚Äôapproche et de centraliser les donn√©es, les transformations, les d√©finitions. Whaly ou dbt sont top pour cela. Des personnes doivent veiller au maintien de coh√©rence de l‚Äôensemble et animer la communaut√© des utilisateurs.

    3Ô∏è‚É£ Des super-tables (peu de tables mais larges et tr√®s bien document√©es) et super-dashboards (peu de dashboards de r√©f√©rence mais bien fournis) permettent de centraliser la connaissance et sont un excellent moyen de limiter les mauvaises interpr√©tations et diminuer la complexit√© afin de rendre autonome. Toute nouvelle connaissance devrait se mat√©rialiser dans ces assets. Les animateurs aident chacun √† faire cela: ce n‚Äôest pas naturel de faire ce travail en plus apr√®s une analyse.

    4Ô∏è‚É£ Il y a plusieurs degr√©s d‚Äôautonomie. On peut aussi rendre les data analysts autonomes pour devenir ind√©pendants des data engineers et activer eux m√™mes les donn√©es.


    Merci Christophe Blefari et Pierre de Poulpiquet , j‚Äôai pass√© un tr√®s bon moment et cela m‚Äôa pas mal inspir√©.

    Bonnes vacances! üèñÔ∏è

    I love this very educational video from Richard Shenghua (ÂçáÂçé) He which explains how a SQL query can export BigQuery data towards any other systems. ü§©


    It means you can now send BigQuery data directly from your dbt models or dbt post hooks ‚ö°:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ to a realtime database such as datastore for fast data serving
    2Ô∏è‚É£ to chat systems such as slack, google chat
    3Ô∏è‚É£ to excel files sent by emails
    4Ô∏è‚É£ to literrally any API üëÄ

    BigQuery is perfect for massive calculations, but is not designed to obtain key-value data very quickly.

    And in the following use cases, you'd love to be able to retrieve quickly customer-profiles pre-computed in BigQuery:

    1Ô∏è‚É£  Content personalization üìÑ
    2Ô∏è‚É£  Real-time notifications üí¨
    3Ô∏è‚É£  Embedded Analytics üìà
    4Ô∏è‚É£  Fraud-fighting üê±‚Äçüë§


    Hopefully, El-Walid Ibrahim from Esmoz created a BigQuery function to export BigQuery data to Google Datastore which is specifically designed to obtain key-value data. üëÄ

    You can even use a dbt post-hook (as seen in the image) to sync your dbt model to Datastore automatically at `dbt run`  üò≤


    Actually, you don't event need dbt. It works in SQL ‚ö°.
    So it will also work in your dataform, sqlmesh, scheduled queries, etc.

    Just try this in your BigQuery üëá:
    -------------------------------------------------
    select bigfunctions.eu.export_to_datastore(
    ¬† ¬† 'your-project',
    ¬† ¬† 'your_namespace',
    ¬† ¬† 'your_kind',
    ¬† ¬† 'user1234',
    ¬† ¬† json '{"score": 0.99}'
    )

    When Axel Thevenot from Devoteam came to me and told me:
    üëâ ‚ùù What if we had a function capable of executing any python code inside BigQuery? ‚ùû

    I was like:
    1Ô∏è‚É£  Wow, this is potentially a game changer! üò≤
    2Ô∏è‚É£  Yes, but it raises a ton of security concerns üòà


    Working together, we finally managed to create that function which enables anyone to execute arbitrary python code in BigQuery while keeping things secure (thanks to sandboxing). üöÄ


    Try it! (it works without install):
    select bigfunctions.eu.run_python('return 1 + 1', null, null)

    Every BigQuery user can NOW ask questions over their data in English.

    The BigQuery function 'ask_my_data' converts your English question into SQL adapted to your data and execute it.

    To try it, simply execute the query written in first comment.
    (no install required!)


    ? How does it work?

    1Ô∏è‚É£ The function retrieves the table schema from INFORMATION_SCHEMA
    2Ô∏è‚É£ It asks a Google language model to generate the SQL code from your question and the table schema.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ It executes the generated query üöÄ


    üêõ Does it always work?
    Probably not.
    Yet, I noted that if the names of your columns are self-explanatory, it works very often. And if it fails, the functions gives you details why and you can adjust your question.


    ‚ûï How can I get more info?
    -  BigFunctions is an open-source catalog of BigQuery functions.
    -  Read 'ask_my_data' doc: https://lnkd.in/ePp9pYiv


    ‚ù§Ô∏è BigFunctions is fully Open-Source
    If you like it, consider adding a ‚≠ê  on the GitHub repo, and we'll build more!

    You want to generate PDF files from BigQuery to:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate custom PDF reports with data
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate customized PDF files by client


    One good example is when you need to generate monthly pdf invoices based on client consumptions. üßê


    You can now do this with one BigQuery query üëÄ
    Indeed, Guillaume Pivette from Neoxia created a function to convert html (built from user data) to pdf.  üôå


    The following query will:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Get an invoice as html from internet
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Convert it to pdf
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Send it to YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS

    Just try it, you'll be amazed! üò≤
    (it works in your own BigQuery without install)


    ---

    select¬†
    ¬†¬†bigfunctions.eu.send_mail(
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS',
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†'Email¬†from¬†BigQuery¬†with¬†PDF¬†attached',
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†'''
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†BigQuery¬†can¬†send¬†personalized¬†emails!
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†Your¬†PDF¬†is¬†attached!
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†''',
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†'invoice.pdf',
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†(select¬†
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†bigfunctions.eu.html2pdf(

    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†)
    ¬†¬†¬†¬†))
    )

    ---

    (in a real world example, you would not download the html through the internet of course, but build it in BigQuery from your customer data. You can check render_string bigfunction to help you with that).

    Google released new language models paLM2 this wednesday and I could not wait to add a bigquery integration. üòä

    üëâ You can now run in BigQuery:
    select¬†bigfunctions.eu.ask_bison('ANY QUESTION')  üò≤


    So asking it the question in the image, I learned two SQL things that I didn't know:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ ¬†We can compare timestamps with dates expressed in string.
    2Ô∏è‚É£  In `order by` clause we can put the alias of the computed aggregate


    Regardless of these tips, what amazed me the most was that I could improve my skills so easily. üëÄ

    I'd be very happy to read in comments how you think generative AI will help you.

    Did you know you can query any API from BigQuery üëÄ?



    By enabling data-practitioners to query data-sources without first moving the data to the data-warehouse, BigQuery has been a pioneer in Zero-ETL.

    You probably know that you can query data from bigtable, spanner, cloud sql, google sheets, files, etc using BigQuery interface. But did you know you can also query data from any API using BigQuery üëÄ??

    --------------------------------------------------
    select bigfunctions.eu.get('ANY_API_URL', null)
    --------------------------------------------------




    üëÄ Johan PROTIN from Zenika went further by creating a function to get latest exchange rates.
    Try it! üëá
    --------------------------------------------------
    select bigfunctions.eu.exchange_rate('USD', 'EUR')
    --------------------------------------------------




    Did I mention this is fully open-source?
    Please add a ‚≠ê to the GitHub if you want more of these functions.

    While working in a non-production environment you may want to generate fake data for testing purposes.

    Shivam Singh brought the great `faker` python library directly into BigQuery so that you can call it directly without install. üëÄ


    Just try the following query:

    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    select
    ¬† bigfunctions.eu.faker('first_name', ¬† 'it_IT') ¬†as first_name,
    ¬† bigfunctions.eu.faker('last_name', ¬† ¬† null) ¬† ¬†as last_name,
    ¬† bigfunctions.eu.faker('email', ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† null) ¬† ¬†as email,
    ¬† bigfunctions.eu.faker('address', ¬† ¬† ¬† null) ¬† ¬†as address,
    ¬† bigfunctions.eu.faker('date_of_birth', null) ¬† ¬†as date_of_birth,
    from unnest(generate_array(1, 100))
    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


    You can also deploy the function in one-click in your own project. Follow the Readme in GitHub. üí°

    ELT has a drawback over ETL.

    As you get data without transform from your sources into you warehouse, (using fivetran, airbyte or any other modern-data-stack ingestion tool), your warehouse will contain personal data that you need to redact before exposing it to users.

    This new BigQuery function from Shivam Singh that you can call without install from your project may then help you üëÄ.

    Felipe Hoffa inspired me for a long time by writing content about data-warehousing and in particular:
    üëâ how to create functions on top of your data-warehouse to give super-powers to your data-analysts . üí•


    For instance:

    1. geolocate IP address: https://lnkd.in/gTPdqfAi

    2. send emails from your warehouse: https://lnkd.in/gFeTpuqk

    3. various functions including text fuzzy matching: https://lnkd.in/gXar3_ZP


    I'd even say it may have influenced me for my personal project:
    üëâ create a catalog of open-source functions so that data-analysts stop reinventing the wheel üëâ  bigfunctions.


    Thanks Felipe Hoffa for inspiring me.
    You again inspired me tonight and I deployed this new open-source bigquery function for time-series forecasting using prophet.

    What if a data-analyst needs to compute the sentiment score of a customer survey comment. He would ask a data-engineer.
    Really?


    BigFunctions is an open-source catalog of advanced bigquery functions callable from your GCP project.

    Just try it with:
    ```
    select bigfunctions.eu.sentiment_score('I love your product!')
    ```


    We are looking for ‚≠ê !

    Like some of us, I have dreamed of creating a product for a long time. But every time I wanted to get started, I found an excuse not to do it.

    Then I met Nacer Ibn Abdeljalil, the first Moroccan to successfully climb Everest and he gave me this advice:

    Make your Everest public. Tell your relatives about your goal. This will make your idea more real and commit you to your friends and colleagues.


    So I did. And soon after, the magic happened ‚ú®. It was like I had already started. I then decided to make it real as a side-project.

    I created BigFunctions an open-source project to empower data-analysts and bigquery  users and keep them from reinventing the wheel.¬†I already had a lot of positive feedback from the data-community and this is already a great achievement.

    üëâ Make your Everest public


    üôè To help me to reach my goal of 200 stars on GitHub and make this open-source side-project a success, I'd be really thankful if you can add a ‚≠ê on GitHub here: https://lnkd.in/emfVXKjJ

    To help your data-analysis you may want to discretize continuous values into bins of equal width.

    1Ô∏è‚É£ You can then easily count how many values you have in each range and have a better understanding of your data. Hello histograms.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ It may improve your machine-learning algorithms as a preprocessing test.

    Last week, a question was asked in our modern-data-stack slack-community:¬†
    "how do you get if a date is a public-holiday in your data-warehouse?"

    I realized this is a very common question.¬†

    Why should all data-teams implement their own implementation of such a basic function?

    Why not to have a common git repo where all data-teams would contribute to build a common library of useful functions callable from any BigQuery project for free?


    This is exactly one of the reason of existence of BigFunctions.
    üëâ https://lnkd.in/eHQ-2spu

    If you like it, support it!
    - tell us in a comment what next BigFunction should be implemented
    - add a star in our GitHub repo. This helps us a LOT!
