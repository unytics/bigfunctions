  List BigQuery resources
  in current Google Cloud `project` enriched with their BigQuery usage in current `project`.

  BigQuery resources include tables, views, columns, datasets, users.

  For each data asset, a `popularity` score is computed. For example, for a table, it is equal to the number of distinct users which read the table in the latest 30 days using `execution_projects`.

  The result is written into `bigfunction_result` temporary table which has the following columns:

  - `id`: unique identifier of the data asset
  - `type`: asset type such as tables, views, datasets, users, etc.
  - `name`: asset name
  - `description`: asset description
  - `popularity`: popularity as float64 (the higher the more popular)
  - `details`: a json blob with asset additional details such as the tables of a dataset or the users of a table.
examples:
  - description: ""
    arguments:
      - "'you-bigquery-project'"
