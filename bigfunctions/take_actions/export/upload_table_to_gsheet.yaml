  Upload data from `table_or_view_or_query` to Google Sheet
  (maximum `max_rows` rows will be uploaded).

  > 1. ðŸ’¡ For this to work, share your Google Sheet in edit mode to `749389685934-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
  > 2. `write_mode` controls what is done if a worksheet with `worksheet_name` already exists. It must be one of:
  >     - `write_truncate`: if the sheet already exists, it will be recreated.
  >     - `write_append`: if the sheet already exists, data will be appended to it.
  >     - `raise_error`:  if the sheet already exists, an error will be raised.
  >     - `do_nothing`:  if the sheet already exists, nothing will be done.
  >     - `null`: same as `write_truncate`
