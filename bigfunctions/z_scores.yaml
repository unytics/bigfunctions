  Compute `z_scores`
  for each value of `arr` array.

  The [Z-Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) is the number of standard deviations by which the value is above or below the mean value.
arguments:
  - name: arr
    type: any type
output:
  name: z_scores
  type: any type
examples:
  - description: ""
    arguments:
      - "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"

    with stats as (
      select
        avg(value) as mean,
        stddev_pop(value) as stddev
      from unnest(arr) as value
    )

    select array_agg(
      if(
        stats.stddev = 0,
        0,
        (value - stats.mean) / stats.stddev
      )
