  Calculates n-gram similarity between two strings

  !!! note ""

      The n-gram comparison algorithm is a method used to measure the similarity between two strings by analyzing their subsequence of n consecutive characters, called n-grams. The process of the n-gram comparison algorithm involves the following steps:

      1. N-gram Extraction: Divide each input string into overlapping sequences of n characters.
      2. Counting N-grams: Count the occurrences of each unique n-gram in both strings.
      3. Calculating Similarity: Compare the n-gram counts between the two strings and compute a similarity score. The similarity score is here calculated with cosine similarity.

      *The above description is taken from [Yassine EL KHAL article](https://yassineelkhal.medium.com/the-complete-guide-to-string-similarity-algorithms-1290ad07c6b7#0b4c)*

  Example of n-gram: the sentence `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet`
  gives the following 4-grams `['LORE', 'OREM', 'REM ', 'EM I', 'M IP', ' IPS', 'IPSU', ...]`

  Returned similarity score is between 0 and 1, 1 meaning that the strings are the most similar.
arguments:
  - name: string1
    type: string
  - name: string2
    type: string
  - name: n
    type: int64
output:
  name: similarity
  type: float64
examples:
  - description: "Calculate n-gram frequency similarity between two simple strings with n=2"
    arguments:
      - "hello world"
      - "world hello"
      - 2
    output: "0.8"
  - description: "Calculate n-gram frequency similarity between two phrases with n=3"
    arguments:
      - "The quick brown fox"
      - "The quick brown dog"
      - 3
    output: "0.82"
  - description: "Calculate n-gram frequency similarity between two sentences with n=4"
    arguments:
      - "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
      - "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing."
      - 4
    output: "0.93"
