  Return `url` parts
  *(inspired from [sql-snippets repo](https://github.com/count/sql-snippets/blob/main/bigquery/regex-parse-url.md))*
arguments:
  - name: url
    type: string
output:
  name: url_parts
  type: struct<host string, path string, query string, ref string, protocol string>
examples:
  - description: ""
    arguments:
      - "'https://www.yoursite.com/pricing/details?myparam1=123&myparam2=abc#newsfeed'"
    output: struct<'www.yoursite.com' as host, 'pricing/details' as path, 'myparam1=123&myparam2=abc#newsfeed' as query, 'newsfeed' as ref, 'https' as protocol>
code: |
  struct(
    regexp_extract(url, r'(?:[a-za-z]+://)?([a-za-z0-9-.]+)/?') as host,
    regexp_extract(url, r'(?:[a-zA-Z]+://)?(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+)/{1}([a-zA-Z0-9-.~_/]+)') as path,
    regexp_extract(url, r'\?(.*)') as query,
    regexp_extract(url, r'#(.*)') as ref,
    regexp_extract(url, r'^([a-za-z]+)://') as protocol
  )
