  Returns `frequent_values` among array of `values`

  This function computes the frequency of each value in `values` array and returns the values which frequency is stricly above the given `frequency_threshold`.
arguments:
  - name: values
    type: any type
  - name: frequency_threshold
    type: float64
output:
  name: frequent_values
  type: any type
examples:
  - description: |
      Detect frequent strings in an array of strings with a `frequency_threshold` of 0.2.
      `banana` appears 3 times for an array of 6 elements so its frequency
      is 3 / 6 = 0.5 > 0.4.
      It is a frequent string compared to the `frequency_threshold`.
    arguments:
      - '["apple", "apple", "banana", "banana", "banana", "cherry"]'
      - "0.4"
    output: "[\"banana\"]"
