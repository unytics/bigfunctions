  Return the `offset` (zero-based index) of the first `value` in `arr` where `value >= x`
  (or `null` if no `value` is greater than `x`).
arguments:
  - name: arr
    type: any type
  - name: x
    type: any type
output:
  name: offset
  type: int64
examples:
  - description: "When a strictly greater `value` exists in array"
    arguments:
      - "[0, 20, 50, 80, 100]"
      - "25"
    output: "2"
  - description: "When an identical `value` exists in array"
    arguments:
      - "[0, 20, 50, 80, 100]"
      - "20"
    output: "1"
  - description: "When a greater `value` does NOT exist in array"
    arguments:
      - "[0, 20, 50, 80, 100]"
      - "110"
    output: "null"
code: |
  (
    select offset
    from unnest(arr) as value
    with offset
    where value >= x
    order by offset
    limit 1
  )
