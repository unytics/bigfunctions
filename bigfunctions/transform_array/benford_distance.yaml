  Calculate the distance from Benford's Law for given `values`.

  As mentioned in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law), *Benford's law, is an observation that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is likely to be small. In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time.*

  This function computes the Chi-square distance between the observed distribution of leading digits of `values` and the expected distribution according to Benford's Law.

  The smaller the `benford_distance`, the more the `values` follow Benford's Law.
