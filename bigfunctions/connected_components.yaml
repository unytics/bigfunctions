  Compute the connected components of a non-directed graph.

  Given a table with two columns of the same type STRING or INTEGER representing the edges of a graph,
  this computes a new temporary table called `bigfunction_result` containing two columns of the same type
  named `node_id` and `connected_component_id`.

  This is an implementation of the Alternating Algorithm (large-star, small-star) described in the 2014 paper
  "Connected Components in MapReduce and Beyond" written by {rkiveris, silviol, mirrokni, rvibhor, sergeiv} @google.com

  PERFORMANCE AND COST CONSIDERATIONS

  - This algorithm has been proved to converge in O(log(n)²) and is conjectured to converge in O(log(n)), where n
  is the number of nodes in the graph. It was the most performant known distributed connected component algorithm
  last time I checked (in 2017).
  - This implementation persists temporary results at each iteration loop: for the BigQuery pricing, you should
  be expecting it to cost the equivalent of 15 to 30 scans on your input table. Since the input table has only
  two columns, this should be reasonable, and we recommend using INTEGER columns rather than STRING when possible.
  - If your graph contains nodes with a very high number of neighbors, the algorithm may crash. It is recommended
  to apply a pre-filtering on your nodes and remove nodes with a pathologically high cardinality.
  You should also monitor actively the number of nodes filtered this way and their cardinality, as this could help
  you detect a data quality deterioration in your input graph.
  If the input graph contains duplicate edges, they will be automatically removed by the algorithm.

  ISOLATED NODES: If you want to have isolated nodes (nodes that have no neighbors)
  in the resulting graph, there is two possible ways to achieve this:

  - Add self-loops edges to all your nodes in your input graph (it also works if you add edges between all the graph
     nodes and a fictitious node with id NULL)
  - Only add edges between distinct nodes to your input, and perform a join between your input graph and the
     algorithm's output to find all the nodes that have disappeared. These will be the isolated nodes.
     This second method requires a little more work but it should also be cheaper.
