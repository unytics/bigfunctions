## BigFunctions project is two fold


1. **Share common useful BigFunctions among the data-community.** <br>BigFunctions defined in 'bigfunctions' folder are all deployed and callable from any BigQuery project without installation. They literally give you **SQL-superpowers** with
    - advanced transforms such as computing sentiment score of a text, or computing the latitude, longitude of an address, graph algorithms, etc
    - advanced data-explorations/vizualisations from your BigQuery console, your notebooks, your IDE.
    - communication with all your SAAS to bring a common logic orchestrated from your data-warehouse and optionnaly from dbt.
2. **Define a framework to easily develop, test and deploy routines called BigFunctions to BigQuery.**


👉 If you are interested in calling great BigFunctions, go [here](https://unytics.github.io/bigfunctions/).
👉 Otherwise if you wish to contribute or if you wish to deploy BigFunctions in your own GCP project, keep reading!
