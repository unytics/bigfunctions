    Technologies make roles change. 

    Since the rise of cloud data-warehouses and the birth of dbt, data engineers don’t do data transform anymore. SQL speaking people do: the analytics engineers.

    With the rise of generative AI, analytics engineers may build data-apps too.

    This is the reasoning of Marcus with who I got a great conversation last week.


    It resonated with my own convictions.

    But while Marcus was thinking of analytics engineers making streamlit apps, I think there is space again for SQL.

    Evidence  tagline “Build polished data apps with SQL” goes exactly in that direction. Archie’s team is inspiring.


    In 2025, I hope to make my own contribution with a data-apps framework - for data activation - made for SQL users.

    If you’re interested in data-apps too, leave me a message, I’d love to have a chat!


    What’s your take on this?

    Will SQL users build data-apps?

    What for?

    👉  To me, Timo Dechau creates some of the best content about Product Analytics.

    I've been following him for two years now, and he's forged my convictions about event data.


    Don't know Timo yet?

    Read this:

    ●  From Events to Activities: https://lnkd.in/gsSJWtPc

    ●  Combine Mixpanel and data-warehouse data (part 1):  https://lnkd.in/gxeCTMjW

    ●  Combine Mixpanel and data-warehouse data (part 2):  https://lnkd.in/g833ZNcN

    ●  Sessions vs Users: https://lnkd.in/gNCae3UB


    Today, Timo created an article about my personal open-source project: bigfunctions

    To be honest, it's much much better than anything I could have written myself.

    ●  From SQL to Slack: https://lnkd.in/gaWwQzZq


    So now, I am even more thankful to you Timo! 🙌

    Luckily, I had just recorded a hands-on session with Paul Marcombes about BigFunctions. And we discussed exactly this use case and did a quick demo. So I got it up and running in just 5 minutes.

    I just published an introduction to BigFunctions (blog and video) - an open-source project that enables analysts to automate data workflows directly from SQL.

    Key takeaways:
    - Deploy pre-built functions in 5 minutes to GCP
    - Send data-driven notifications to Slack
    - Enrich data with API responses and AI without engineering support
    - Seamless integration with dbt

    The best part? It's all SQL-native. No infrastructure management needed.

    His article, "Beyond SQL as a Pure Database Syntax," really captures what we're trying to achieve.

    I'm happy with this article because it highlights:

    •  SQL's limitations for complex analytics.
    •  How BigFunctions improves reusability and workflow by bringing functionality and composability to SQL.
    •  How it supports a separation of concerns for data teams.

    But I recently realized that SQL's syntax isn't the real problem. The core issue lies in its underlying semantics – how we actually interact with and understand our data

    In tech (and in general), semantics often struggles to keep pace with syntax. In my latest blog post, I explore how modern tooling like Unytics BigFunctions help to bridge this crucial gap between SQL's origins and modern analytics needs

    🔹 2024
    In 2024, I built 4 Open-Source Data Apps:

    -  bigfunctions
    -  airbyte-serverless
    -  catalog-builder
    -  data-api

    They got thousands of users and I often received nice messages. I must admit it's quite satisfying 🤗 . Thanks everyone.


    🔹 2025
    In 2025, I want to accelerate.
    I'd love to make a living of building Data Apps.


    👉 If you're thinking of activating data from your data-platform to generate value, I'd love to have a chat.

    I am looking for new ideas and would be happy to share mine.

    Interested in a 30-minute discussion with me?
    Send me a message! 🙌


    Enjoy your day!

    I had a great talk this morning with Burak, CEO of Bruin at DATANOSCO podcast from Stéphane.


    Burak shared his vision to bring an all-in-one data-platform through bruin.

    Here are key elements:

    1/ NO no-code! 
    Bruin is code and configuration-based first. It's built around standards to fasten development. It makes it versionable in git and easily extensible.

    2/ All-in-one changes everything
    Bruin can provide templates to get started loading some data from a specific source up to making the data transforms in a opinionated way. If you had to mix different tools, the user experience would be much less fluid. What's more, this considerably reduces the amount of gluing required for data engineers.

    3/ Built on open-source
    Bruin team created ingestr, a wrapper above dlt from dltHub to ingest data from any data-warehouse. Building above top open-source data tools makes bruin benefits from the data-community to get fast and on top. Giving back to open-source is part of the deal.


    Thanks a lot Stéphane for the invitation to your podcast! Burak, I will be follow what you build with attention!

    1/ Modern-Data-Stack limitations
    Modern-data-stack brought data tooling for any data service:

    - Fivetran for ingestion.
    - dbt Labs for transform.
    - Hightouch for activation.
    - Prefect for orchestration
    - SYNQ for reliability
    - CastorDoc for catalog

    This has been seen as a revolution.
    Whatever your need, there's a tool for it.

    BUT is also led to a common criticism.

    👉 You still need to choose, understand, buy and manage all of these tools from different vendors. 🤦‍♂️


    2/ Hello all-in-one data-platforms
    That's when all-in-one data-platforms came in.
    Y42 brings a one-stop-shop for companies to handle their data-platforms.

    Problem solved!

    BUT, y42 only runs inside y42.

    👉 Hello vendor lock-in. 🤦‍♂️


    3/ Bruin: the new player in the game
    That's when Bruin entered the game.

    They provide a all-in-one data-platform with ingestion, SQL transform, python jobs (for custom load, transform or activation), and orchestration.

    It works locally, it's mostly open-source, and you can run it everywhere.

    Did I mention it also comes with a VS code extension to streamline development?

    I am impressed about what they built in a year.


    Do you share my enthusiasm? Why not?

    I started working 13 years ago in medical imaging.
    We were 5 people in the company.
    We built ultrasound scanners from end to end.
    I was impressed by our speed compared to our competitors.

    It was because we were small.
    Us, engineers, were in direct contact with doctors.
    We were able to discover their problems in the morning and ship solutions in the afternoon.

    At that time I thought that competitors with hundreds of employees were unlucky.
    They would never be as fast as us.
    Their flow from idea to delivery contained too numerous asphixying steps.

    This was before I came to Nickel.


    👉 At Nickel, I realized that you can be 900 employees and still be fast.

    One way is to get autonomous teams
    while respecting big companies requirements.

    One key for this is to create a FRAMEWORK which:

    ✅ is a space of trust in which teams can make their own decisions.
    ✅ defines guidelines and standards (security, compliance, brand, etc.).
    ✅ defines boundaries that limit teams inter-dependencies.
    ✅ comes with platform tools & platform teams to go faster while harmonizing the work.


    For example:

    ❌ BAD ➜ teams depend on CENTRAL BOTTLENECK committees for validation of everything. Even minor initiatives.

    ✅ GOOD ➜ security team gives you the autonomy to build stuff while helping you to follow cybersecurity standards.

    👉 AVOID bottlenecks & EMPOWER people within a FRAMEWORK.


    I may give details of how we did for Nickel data people in a next post.
    Stay tuned.


    I wish you a Happy New Year!

    BigFunctions lets you use Python functions directly in BigQuery, and thanks to its prebuilt functions, you can even run LLMs through SQL. It’s a great way to extend BigQuery’s capabilities without needing external tools.

    In my case, I wanted to quickly get foundational details (country, city, and year of establishment) for some well-known football teams. Using the ask_ai function, I was able to send a simple prompt, get structured responses, and parse them—all within BigQuery.

    This is just one example, but there’s a lot more you can do with it. It’s a practical tool that simplifies working with AI and Python in a SQL environment.
    Big thanks to Paul for building and sharing this!

    Static BI is about creating interactive dashboards on top of Parquet files.

    It's trending since we can run duckdb in the browser.

    If you follow this area, you already know Observable and Evidence tools.


    But I am pretty sure you don't know mozaic yet.


    ➜ Mozaic Dashboards are interactive, fast, based on parquet files and they can deal with a lot of data.

    ➜ What make them great in my opinion is that you can generate them on the fly using a simple yaml configuration AND with vanilla javascript.

    NO MORE front-end build or deployment needed!


    This opens a wide new area for static BI.

    In the example of the screenshot, I am downloading a YAML configuration file from another website and generating the dashboard on the fly with it!

    It means that we can share YAML configurations templates for common dashboards on common analyses 😲.

    The example is in the comment. Don't hesitate to play with it. It's fun.


    In your opinion, is there a place for static BI?
    What would you use it for?

    Ali Izadi built dozens of handy SQL queries to cover areas like 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝘀𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀, 𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙚𝙧𝙘𝙚 𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙘𝙨, 𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙛𝙛𝙞𝙘 𝙖𝙩𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙗𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙣 𝙎𝙀𝙊 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝘼𝙙𝙨.

    It's free, it's open source. It's available in 'Bigquery-GA4-Queries' GitHub repo.


    We built together with Ali an integration of 'Bigquery-GA4-Queries' on bigfunctions.

    By calling a bigfunction, you will automatically create all the queries of the GitHub repo as table functions in your GCP project.


    We hope it will make it even easier to get started with these awesome queries.

    Links are in comments. Please add a star to Ali's repo if you want to support his work.

    I often need to get the Net Promoter Score from customer surveys.


    The formula is "% promoters - % detractors".

    It's not very complex.

    I could re-write this formula each time.


    But as an engineer,

    I really prefer to put this logic in a function.

    And re-use this function everywhere.


    How do you do it on your side?

    Both tools are used by millions of developers everyday to deploy their documentation website.

    Which one to choose?


    ➜  It depends if your a pythonist or a front end engineer.


    With docusaurus you can mix mardown with react components. It brings huge possibilities in an elegant mannner.

    But if you’re not a front end engineer but a pythonist you will find docusaurus over complicated and would rather stick with mkdocs (using Mkdocs material or readthedoc themes).



    ☝ I feel the same for bi as code tools.

    Observable and evidence.dev look absolutely awesome to me.

    But as a pythonist I think we can do simpler.

    I am even considering making bi as code  with a simple mkdocs plugin.

    Would you be interested?

    Am I wrong with the above thoughts?

    -  finding the nearest point of sale for a customer.
    -  visualizing you sales on a map
    -  doing geo data analysis


    Now, it's easier than ever to do so directly in BigQuery.

    Kévin from EFFIDIC  created a function today that geocode addresses using an open api from data.gouv.fr. 👏

    Modern Data Stack have tools to do everything with data.

    Everything EXCEPT custom stuff.

    ➜ you end up with a ton of python scripts floating around.


    Kestra aims to solve this.

    They propose a central tool to orchestrate your jobs in a declarative way.


    We propose ANOTHER way.

    We propose you simply use dbt instead (or sqlmesh or dataform).

    It means all your jobs must be callable from SQL.

    Which is easy nowadays.

    As data-warehouses natively do python callable from SQL.


    What if you could easily build :

    -  a catalog
    -  of advanced functions
    -  callable by anyone from SQL
    -  & defined in a declarative manner

    ?


    Say hi to the SQL Declarative-Data-Stack!


    What's your opinion on this?

    Would you be ready to do everything from SQL?

    If not, Why?

    ```

    I'm thinking something like this (images attached). The "engine" is basically only transpiling from config to the actual data stack with multiple adapters— e.g., dbt, SDF, SQLMesh for `transform()`.

    I can't help but think about DWH Automation (DWA).

    > Config = template
    > Engine = DWA
    > DDS = generated SQLs

    If you were to implement a declarative data stack engine (DDSE), would you focus on the *one-time* generation of a data stack (second image attached) or the continuous update?

    What I mean is, would you fix or update configs/templates as DWA did or the artifacts (SQL, YAMLs) without touching the generated code?

    Any thoughts? 🤔 Gregor Zeiler, Jan Kaul, Matthew Kosovec and others in my network?

    If your microservices could consume your dbt models with low latency, you'd unlock great use cases:

    ⇨  content personalization
    ⇨  embedded analytics
    ⇨  feature flipping
    ⇨  feature store
    ⇨  etc


    These slides demonstrate how analytics-engineers can expose their dbt models as API endpoints with one line in dbt.

    (they are a re-work from our presentation at API Days with Hachem LATRACH yesterday).

    Looking forward to reading your comments.

    What is your use cases for consuming a low-latency api on dbt models data?

    This morning with Hachem LATRACH from Nickel  we were at API Days Paris.

    We explained several use cases where YOU WANT to expose your dbt models as an api.


    We demonstrated how you can build a:

    -  scalable (millions of requests / s),
    -  serverless,
    -  low latency (milliseconds)

    data-api on top of dbt models by a simple sql line in dbt configuration.

    Interested?

    But there is even more. BigFunctions by Unytics offers even more extremely convenient ways to bring data into BigQuery. For example, it is now possible to ingest GoogleTrends data through the API with a simple function call:

    select bigfunctions.eu.get_google_trends('bigquery', null, 'today 5-y', null, null)
    🤩 🚀

    Sure, the output will need to be unpacked with JSON / array functions, but still, a good few hours or days can be saved especially if you don’t have data engineering resources at your disposal.

    Google Trends data can be useful for many reasons, but one can be to check the overall “global” trends of keywords when a website’s organic traffic shows a significant decline for these keywords. Checking what’s going on “outside” the SearchConsole data can help troubleshoot whether we’re dealing with an SEO issue or a decline in interest (i.e. an economical situation).

    This is not an affiliate post. It’s a happy user & fan post. BigFunctions is just soo handy, and free, with many functions ready to use in BigQuery without any setup or “installation”. (Thanks Paul Marcombes)

    Enjoy and leverage Google Trends data!

    Sherloq is a tool to organize and share your SQL queries.

    What caught my eye is the UX:

    >  It feels like an integral part of your data warehouse console.
    >  (thanks to a browser extension).


    I could not wait to build my own chrome extension.


    It’s fun because I started BigFunctions two years ago by making visualizations in BigQuery console.

    But it was hacky (inspect the page and inject JavaScript) and I could not find an elegant way.

    I think I just did.

    We often talk about self-service analytics.

    It’s a way to democratize data access in a company. It focuses on all people.

    But we forget to think about self-service for data-analysts.

    Company people used to be dependent on data-analysts to access data. Self-service analytics changed that.

    Data-analysts are still dependent on data-engineers to do their job. Self-service for data-analysts change that.

    What if data engineers became data-platform engineers, building a catalog of tools that the data-analysts could pick to achieve their job?

    Self-served data-analysts would not be dependent anymore.

    It would open much more scalability to answer data needs.

    It would foster creativity.

    It would boost data activation.


    What’s your opinion on this?


    ———

    BigFunctions was built to reach self-served data analysts. It provides them a catalog of services to do everything they need from SQL.

    Text to SQL is great as a coding assistant for Data Analysts.

    But it won’t help for business people to get trusted data answers.


    The problem is that SQL can be quite complex. The LLM has too much freedom. It can generate incorrect stuff too easily.

    It’s OK for a coding assistant. The data analyst will fix it and iterate. It is not acceptable for a CEO.

    You have to constrain stuff.


    We can make the LLM generate requests on a semantic layer instead of SQL.


    Another way would be to have a set of templated queries with parameters.

    The LLM would choose among the templates and guess the correct parameter values.

    For example:

    - A template sql query could be the select of an aggregate of a metric over time with a breakdown on a dimension.

    - Parameters would be the table name, the aggregate function, the metric and the dimension.


    Thanks David Jayatillake  & Naim Kosayyer for opening my eyes on this at Forward Data Conference.

    1/
    - functions are deployed in yaml
    - dbt models are declared in yaml/sql.

    2/
    - functions are tested and deployed with a command line.
    - dbt models are tested and deployed with a command line.

    3/
    - in both frameworks the command line generates a documentation website.


    > With dbt and bigfunctions you can then build a all-in-one data-platform as a declarative data stack.


    Thanks Christophe Blefari, Hymaïa and Modern Data Network for having me at this great forward data conference.

    1. I am father of 3 children of age 3, 8 and 10.

    2. I started gymnastics 2 months ago. It feels like die and retry. It’s fun.

    3. I lived one year in China. I worked in a machine learning research lab. It felt like pressing the pause button.

    4. I need to escape one weekend a year. I take a night train. With my bike. And I ride for 48h.

    5. My dream is to build data apps, quit my job and make a living from it.

    At Nickel, we've built a configurable data engine:

    ✅ that allows data analysts to deploy algorithms
    ✅ in batch or real time
    ✅ configured in SQL

    on a wide range of use cases:

    👉 real-time communications (sms, push, email, etc).
    👉 fight against financial crime
    👉 content personalization
    👉 reversal of functionalities
    👉 etc.


    Do NOT deploy Algorithms!
    —> Deploy configurable platforms!
    Your impact will be 10x



    Delighted to have been able to talk about it on iziday’s Boris Fievet  mic.

    I bet for sqlmesh.


    Simply because sqlmesh paid product does not compete with their open-source product. It’s complementary.

    While dbt has little interest in improving dbt-core, sqlmesh, as a challenger, has to be much better to be adopted.

    Actually sqlmesh is already in the lead when it comes to developer experience, and it is just the beginning.

    Go go go Tobias (Toby) Mao and Tobiko !

    ✅  qui permet aux data-analystes de déployer des algos
    ✅  batch ou temps réel
    ✅  configurés en SQL

    sur plein de cas d'usages:

    👉 communications temps réel (sms, push, email, etc)
    👉 lutte contre le crime financier
    👉 personnalisation de contenu
    👉 feature flipping
    👉 etc


    Ne déployez PAS des ALGOS 
    --> Créez des PLATEFORMES multi-usages.
    --> Et démultipliez le pouvoir data.

    🚀 Paul Marcombes, Head of Data de Nickel, présente comment l'entreprise utilise l'IA pour améliorer l’expérience client et les processus internes.

    Il présente comment Nickel associe moteurs de recherche et génération de contenu pour créer des solutions IA adaptées.

    Son message essentiel: Bien séparer la partie moteur de recherche de la partie génération de contenu. Les utilisateurs veulent voir la vraie data !

    Avec ce retour d'expérience, Paul met en avant une solution simple permettant aux utilisateurs de questionner les retours des clients sur des plateformes comme l’App Store ou Trustpilot via du RAG et de la recherche hybride, adaptées à la gestion rapide et efficace des informations pour les équipes.

    Nickel compte aujourd'hui 4 millions de comptes ouverts en 10 ans, une présence dans 5 pays et 11 000 points partenaires en Europe. L'entreprise a 200 utilisateurs SQL qui exploitent les insights des données.

    The easiest way to get a holistic view of your text data is to categorize it.

    You'll instantly get:

    ➜ the main topics,
    ➜ the number of texts associated to each,
    ➜ the evolution of these metrics over time


    Here's an example of how I've categorized our user reviews at Nickel.
    I'm impressed by the results.


    It can also be applied to customer support tickets.

    It can also be applied to the Information schema of your database to get a business classification of your tables.

    What other use cases do you see?

    All BI teams are working hard to enable users to get insights from natural language questions.

    Looker Studio is no exception. Here's what I learnt trying their new Conversational Analytics UI:


    Getting better!
    ➡️  It works great to explore a table
    ➡️  How was this calculated? exposes very clearly how AI provided the answer and quikly gives you trust in the answer.
    ➡️  Insights exposes result interpretation in natural language which is great to copy paste in a presentation
    ➡️  Questions Suggestions are interested to get started
    ➡️  Suggestions for reformulation work very well


    There's still a lot to do
    ➡️  Charts are limited. I found no way for the Agent to result a chart showing the evolution of a metric with a break down on a dimension. Quite restricting for an analysis...
    ➡️  Agent can give you a precise information contained in the table. But forget about asking advanced stuff such as making a feature impact analysis or compare distribution of a metric between two periods.
    ➡️  Actually it can only answer one unique result at a time. You cannot generate multiple charts at once with analysis by different dimensions.


    Should I use Looker Studio Conversational Analytics?
    ➡️  I think it is already an interesting tool to expose some prepared data to end users who are not proficient in SQL nor dashboarding
    ➡️  But if you're a data analyst you would prefer to use BigQuery Canvas which enables to tune your queries and better manage the flow between questions & answers.


    Should I look for other tools?
    The improvement of these tools to enable advanced analysis use cases is just a matter of time. You should definitely keep an eye on what's coming to be ready when it comes.

    I won't we surprised if open-source wins.

    If you're more from engineering here are two tools you want to have a look at:

    You can be the greatest data-analyst, you will never be able to uncover an insight for which you don't have the data.

    Structured data is great: it shows you facts and correlations between phenomena that characterize your product's current situation.

    But you're missing out a ton.

    You can't see what your users are thinking, what they want, what frustrates them.


    I think data analysts should incorporate the “voice of the customer” into their data and take their data analysis to a new level.


    I'll be explaining how to do this in practice at a conference at the Salon Data IA in Nantes, France.

    Retrieval Augmented Generation is one of the best way to get started with GenAI in a company.

    Mathilde Gorieu made us realize at Nickel that while it's very powerful to help people find information from a knowledge base, it does not always offer the best user experience with regard to the use case.

    So instead of embedding a hidden search engine into your RAG system, it's better to decouple search and RAG and offer a User Experience with both functionalities.

    With Mathilde Gorieu we're going to share today what we've learned at Nickel while implementing several RAG use cases.

    We believe that search and RAG are complementary and search should not be hidden inside the RAG.

    Data engineers, are you tired of manually building and managing BigQuery functions? 
    BigFunctions is revolutionizing your workflow!

    💡Created by data guru Paul Marcombes, the open-source project BigFunctions offers 100+ functions ready to implement for your BigQuery projects.

    The most common BigFunctions use cases are:

    • Expand functionality. Despite the array of functions available in BigQuery, there might be occasions where a specific function is needed but not included.
    • Streamline your queries: UDFs act like reusable code snippets in BigQuery. Instead of rewriting the same complicated calculations over and over, define them once as a UDF and then simply reference them wherever needed.
    • Standardization. UDFs act like a playbook for your queries. By creating a UDF for a particular calculation, you ensure everyone is using the same definition, promoting consistency across large teams or complex organizations.

    Check out BigFunctions and what it help you do in our article (link in the comments)

    dbt provides post-hooks.

    Post-hooks are SQL queries that run after model creation.

    Refresh_tableau is a function available to anyone in BigQuery to trigger the refresh of a Tableau source with SQL.

    One can then refresh a Tableau Workbook at the minute its dbt model is re-computed, thanks to a dbt post-hook.

    Many Thanks Antoine Giraud for having created this function in BigFunctions

    1. You'll might need to say NO to more stuff

    3. You should say NO to more stuff
    4. You have to say NO to more stuff
    5. You will fail if you don't say NO to more stuff

    Everyone thinks they need to please everyone when they take on a role in data.

    In reality, you need to get really great at saying NO to low-value requests.

    Otherwise, your team will be a low-value team.

    __

    As a data leader this is your most important job.

    Find the high-value stuff, and say NO to everything else.

    Je participerai à l'atelier : L'Expérience client à l’ère de la data : banques & fintechs en quête d’hyperpersonnalisation

    aux côtés de Pierre LECOMMANDEUR, Societe Generale, Vincent Boclé, namR, Brice Barouch, Provenir, Stéphane Nouy, Moneythor et animée par Solange DAHOME, Colombus Consulting

    Le contexte concurrentiel actuel incite les banques à repenser leur stratégie pour attirer et fidéliser leur clientèle. Une des approches les plus efficaces consiste à déployer une stratégie de personnalisation de l'expérience client, permettant à  la banque d'adapter ses offres aux besoins spécifiques de chaque client.

    L’utilisation des données à l'aide de nouveaux outils soutient cette stratégie d'hyperpersonnalisation. Elle constitue un levier pour enrichir sa proposition de valeur pour les clients et développer sa croissance.

    Tired of endlessly navigating nested fields in your JSON data? 😩
    You're not alone. It's like searching for a needle in a haystack...made of objects and arrays! 🤯


    But what if I told you there's a better way? 🎉
    Introducing the new BigQuery function sql_to_flatten_json_column which parses your json column, guesses the json schema and generates a SQL query to execute to flatten the json column.


    ✨ Say goodbye to nested chaos: Transform complex JSON structures into easy-to-manage flat tables.
    ✨ Query with confidence: Easily access any field without writing convoluted nested queries.
    ✨ Boost your productivity: Spend less time wrangling data and more time extracting insights

    Ready to ditch the JSON struggle?
    ➡️  Function doc: https://lnkd.in/g8DBbwgD

    BigFunctions is fully open-source and functions are available on your GCP project without install.

    Airbyte built awesome open-source connectors to move data into your warehouse.


    What if we could run them via a simple SQL query?


    That's what this function does. You can get data from any public GitHub Repo into your BigQuery project (no install required). It uses Airbyte Github connector under the hood.

    This could work for any Airbyte python connectors.

    Imagine that all you needed was an SQL query to obtain data from any source 😲

    Which source should we prioritize?

    I like this article from Jake Holmquist ☁️ as it describes the two sides of bigfunctions:

    ➡️ Effortless access to advanced BigQuery functions: No installation. Just new SQL power at your fingertips. 🤯

    ➡️ Build your own governed function catalog: Empower your team with a centralized, secure, and reusable function library. 🏗️


    While the first side is well-known, I am not sure about the second one.

    Yet the benefits of building a catalog of functions with BigFunctions are many:

    ✅  Give new power to Data Analysts such as calling your company APIs
    ✅  Promote consistency with a standard to define functions
    ✅  Enable discoverability with a searchable web catalog
    ✅  Use software engineering best practices

    Thanks to remote functions, you can get data from any website into BigQuery with a simple SQL query 🤗

    Here is an example to:

    ✅  Download user reviews of Nickel App from App Store.
    ✅  Translate them into English
    ✅  You can then use GenAI functions & get actionable insights!


    Functions are already available without install in your GCP project.

    Documentation is in comments 👇

    Airbyte (the leading open-source solution to move your data to your data-warehouse) finally released their connectors as python packages. They even released a package (PyAirbyte) to easily use them from python.

    This is great news as:

    ✅  PyAirbyte is standalone: you don't need to install and run an airbyte server anymore!
    ✅  Python practitioners only need to write < 10 line of code to move data from any source to the data-warehouse
    ✅  Deployment can be done easily on serverless compute such as Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Cloud Run Jobs, Lambda functions, etc.


    I created AirbyteServerless last year to solve these exact problems and I am very happy that Airbyte could take some inspiration of it to offer an even better solution. Great work Aaron ("AJ") Steers ! 👏 🎉

    Embed data-people in teams to scale

    One way to scale data analysis is to embed data people in teams, tribes, domains. You give them the autonomy on the whole data chain including transforms.

    Because teams are autonomous to collect data, transform it and expose it to others, you avoid the bottleneck of depending on a central data-team for these tasks. It then gets easier to scale.


    But doing so, you create a risk.

    Data people in teams could come to work differently, with different tools. This can lead to silos with less shareable knowledge. It may become hard to maintain and not optimal.


    One way to solve that is to build data guilds

    Guilds are communities of data people with shared interests such as analytics engineering to share knowledge, tools code and practices.

    While guilds are great you may want to have people working full time to improve practices.


    The Staff Analytics Engineer Role

    We had a great talk last week from Martin Lang et Dimitri Antakly from Decathlon Digital who introduced their role: Staff Analytics Engineer.


    The Staff Analytics-Engineer is in the central data team and:

    ✅  Takes a step back to improve the analytics engineering practices
    ✅  Animates the community of data-people working on transforms
    ✅  Helps data-people and Provides guidelines
    ✅  Tests new tools

    Martin and Dimitri gave a great example of their added value:

    They identified a problem of re-work between tribes and they (with the community) decided to create a shared dbt zone with shared transforms between the sources and the tribes transforms.


    🙏 Martin and Dimitri for this very inspiring talk.
    🙏 Stéphane Heckel from DATANOSCO for organizing this great Modern-Data Stack conference
    🙏 Criteo for hosting the conference

  text: |
    We had a great presentation from Tangi Gouez and Manuel Cellier from Dashlane last week at Nickel. They told us their tips to take the most of data-analysts in an organization:

    💬 "They must deliver actionable insights at the right moment to generate value".


    💬 "They should NOT start a data-analysis before knowing the actions that will be taken once done.


    A key-factor of failure for data-analysts 📉
    While these tips are great and inspirational, they highlight a key-factor of failure for data-analysts:

    "If you deliver a great insight but the product/development team is not ready to develop the recommended changes, all your data-analysis work is lost and you bring no value" 😾.



    What if data-analysts could take the actions themselves? 💡

    At Nickel, when the team works on "out of stock" issues at points of sale, the data-analyst can, on his own:
    - analyse the problem, quantify the lost value and decide to take actions,
    - build a ML model to predict if a point of sale is "out of stock soon",
    - automatically order some material when "out of stock soon" is predicted.

    No data-engineers need to be involved nor product/development team.

    This is, we believe, how you make your data-analysts impactful:

    🏆  "You give them the power to take the actions themselves" 🏆



    How to do this in your company too? 🚀

    Your company probably built micro-services exposed in a catalog of apis (with one route to order material for one point of sale). What you need is to make these apis available to your data-warehouse.

    That's exactly the purpose of BigFunctions: to build a catalog of advanced functions callable by data-analysts from your data-warehouse. The functions can call your company internal apis or public ones for your saas products.

    👏  Congrats Hugo Mulheim for this work on out of stock issues.

    Querying your BigQuery data in SQL is very natural and efficient but you want to use BigQuery Dataframes (aka Bigframes) if:

    ✅  You come from the pandas world.
    ✅  Your sql becomes too verbose and hard to maintain and you want to group code in functions or to reuse code.
    ✅  You want to write scripts as it is much easier to develop python scripts than stored procedures.

    📢 Announcement
    Every BigFunction (to do advanced transforms) is directly available from BigQuery Dataframes (no install needed!)

    Every data project starts with moving data from different sources to your data-warehouse for analysis. To this end, Airbyte certainly provides the best open-source product with 300+ source connectors and a huge community👀.

    I created a lightweight python package (airbyte-serverless) to manage these connectors in the yaml era and I felt really honored when Modeo contacted me to showcase it to the world during a webinar. 🧡

    What surprised me is that Modeo went further than I anticipated as they used airbyte-serverless to run their own custom connectors. 💪

    It was a real pleasure to meet you Ismael Goulani Lynn Farhat Matthieu Rousseau and build stuff together. I have been impressed by your teamwork actually.  🙌

    I put the webinar video link in first comment.

    If you're not familiar with or not using BigFunctions, be sure to check out the documentation – it's worth it. Thanks to this open-source library, you can add a bit of free magic to your queries.

    Bookmark this post as a cheat sheet.

    BigFunctions provides around 100+ operators for working with data. In terms of functionality, they go beyond standard SQL and cover several interesting use cases.

    You can easily deploy BigFunctions in your Google Cloud project or use operators from this library directly in the BigQuery editor without any installation procedure.

    There's a usage example of BigFunctions in the screenshot, and here are a few intriguing operators:

    - ask_ai, ask_my_data – ask questions not limited to your own data;

    - is_email_valid, is_phone_number_valid – validate contact information;

    - parse_user_agent – parse the User_Agent string in BigQuery;

    - phone_number_info – obtain available information about a phone number;

    - replace_special_characters – remove special characters from a string;

    - translate – translate text into a specified language;

    - min_value, max_value, median_value, sum_values – array aggregation;

    - explore_table, explore_dataset – get information about your table representations along with statistics;

    - deidentify – hide sensitive information in your dataset;

    ✅  Move data with Airbyte Serverless

    ✅  Orchestrate with Google Workflows


    Airbyte is certainly the most advanced open-source system to move your data from any source to your data-warehouse.

    But deploying Airbyte Core to manage connectors can be a hassle if you're not a Kubernetes expert.

    That's why I created Airbyte-Serverless.

    I am kind of proud that Lynn Farhat and Ismael Goulani from Modeo are organizing a live demo to showcase how they use it in production for their clients.

  text: |
    I was at a (great) c2c event last night and I realized two things:

    1️⃣ Without a good catalog, your data-mesh strategy will be a failure as your useful and trusted data won’t be discoverable.
    2️⃣ While there are many great vendors on this space, some companies keep building their own tool instead of buying.

    - ADEO (Leroy Merlin+) built its data-finder
    - Carrefour built its data-supermarket
    - LinkedIn built Data-Hub
    - Lyft built Amundsen
    And the list goes on.


    Why?


    At Nickel, we also decided to build instead of buy. As an entry point of your data, your catalog can become much more than listing assets. And vendors won’t be able to suit the specific needs of your business or your tooling.

    Actually even two of our most basic needs were not always considered:

    1️⃣  Search results MUST be sorted by popularity. (And by popularity I mean usage, not an edited popularity on the catalog by some stewards via promotion or "thumb up").  When I type ˋcustomer` in my portal I have a hundred results. The most used table MUST be on top.

    2️⃣ We use looker studio as BI tool, but most of the time, there’s no connector to it. Btw, I really don’t want to have all company dashboards here, only curated super dashboards with their metadata.


    I’d love to know what you think. Do you build or buy your data-catalog? Why?

    Airbyte is a must-have in your data-stack with its 𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗼𝗴 𝗼𝗳 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻-𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮-𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲.


    When it comes to 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆 Airbyte you have several options:
    1️⃣ use Airbyte Cloud if you want a managed service
    2️⃣ deploy on an instance (quite easy but not robust)
    3️⃣ deploy on kubernetes (hard except if you already have a cluster running).

    This leaves you no choice if you’re a serverless aficionado who likes managed services but likes deploying yourself. 🧐

    👉 Say hi to  𝗔𝗶𝗿𝗯𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀  👀 !!


    Airbyte Serverless:
    ❌ has NO UI
    ❌ has NO database
    ❌ has NO transform layer

    Airbyte Serverless:
    ✅ is run from a CLI
    ✅ is based of yaml files on git
    ✅ can run on serverless compute

    You’ll then have a robust and scalable solution at unbeatable cost with all benefits of cloud native serverless architectures.

    𝗟𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁? Please leave a ⭐️ on the repo!

    𝗝𝗼𝗶𝗻 the discussion on slack! https://lnkd.in/ezVQQMAY


    Warning: only bigquery and cloud run job are supported for now as destination and serverless compute. Any contribution is more than welcome. Join the slack for help getting started.

    … how do you want people to find the information they need from this overcrowded space 🧐?


    At Nickel, since we had "only one" dashboard per domain, we skyrocketed data discovery at the company. 🚀

    We call them super-dashboards (🦸‍♂️) like our very few and large data-warehouse super-tables (🦸‍♀️) which ease table discovery a lot. 👀



    Having a unique super-dashboard for each domain:

    ✅ eases dramatically information discovery
    ✅ then reduces significantly the data questions you receive
    ✅ helps you to consider it as a product and to focus on building a community of users to collect needs and improve it constantly (while striving to keep it light and well organized).


    Having a dedicated chat channel referenced in the dashboard is not a bad idea to collect feedback and make announcements. (👏Clément Pierson).

    The best data is the data you don’t store!

    - I just deleted 3433 tables.
    - And I instantly felt way better. 🤗
    - Wanted to share the feeling. 😁


    We should NOT keep data for 10 years for analytics purposes!
    it's time to vacuum ✨!


    Then:
    1️⃣ You won't pay for storage
    2️⃣ You'll pay much less for querying
    3️⃣ Your queries will be more efficient  
    4️⃣ You'll find your useful data more easily



    For this, the most effective are:

    1️⃣ Partition expiration 🧹
    - Our biggest table at Nickel represented 30 % of our total storage.
    - It happened that sometimes we had to fully rebuild downstream models. That hurt!
    - We felt better when we put a 120 days partition expiration on it.
    - I am sure you also have low hanging fruits.

    2️⃣ Table expiration on Temp datasets ♻️

    3️⃣ Drop tables you don’t read anymore ✨
    👉 This is where the 3433 tables I just deleted came from 👀
    (If it is not clear how to do I can explain in comments)



    Details here https://lnkd.in/exAyPu_C
    and there https://lnkd.in/eNG4_YPy



    This blog post from Tinybird inspired me to name this Rule № 1️⃣.  https://lnkd.in/eeejA-j5

    At Nickel, as dbt jobs costs kept rising we decided to take action. ☝️

    This is when the great Rémi BENOIST  decided to gamify the thing and created our "dbt cost killing championship"! 🏆


    Thanks to his natural enthusiasm, periodic tips and the way he kept instilling rythm in the competition, it has been a tremendous success.

    After a quarter we had reduced our dbt run costs by 30%, had a lot of fun, and our 30 dbt contributors had reached a new level of cost awareness. 💪🚀


    It was only weeks after the awards ceremony that one of us walked into the office and said out loud:

    "Wait, speaking of dbt, don’t dbt tests cost money?"

    The championship focused on dbt models run and looked no further.

    A few minutes later one replied:

    "Well hhmmm, indeed… dbt tests represent half of our total dbt costs" 🤷‍♀️💥



    In a single day, we could dramatically reduce dbt costs for by applying a new strategy to our testing: do not test everything everyday! Test more often the sources, less often the results of the transformations.

    We learnt a lot of lessons that day.

    If you need to remember one:
    Beware of your dbt tests costs!!! 🤑

    If you are into reducing BigQuery costs you may have already explored:
    1️⃣ partitioning your tables
    2️⃣ requiring a partition filter on these tables
    3️⃣ clustering your tables


    BUT have you already explored SEARCH INDEX 🧐 ?


    As you know, BigQuery is NOT designed to find one row in a fat table as:
    - it will scan the entire table to find that row.
    - it will be very expensive
    - and very slow.

    BUT sometimes you really need this use case.
    You have worked hard to consolidate a 360° view of your customers and you want to expose a dashboard to your customer care deparment so that they can look for one particular customer at a time.

    SEARCH INDEX enables you to do exactly this:
    1️⃣ Create a search index on customer_id column of your table
    2️⃣ Use SEARCH bigquery function to look for the data of one customer_id.


    Now I can keep this use case for less than the cost of a cup of coffee! ☕


    Details here: https://lnkd.in/ez2yBpfT
    and there https://lnkd.in/eXHtWXqB

    What's more, Google is expanding indexes use cases dramatically. Read this blog post! https://lnkd.in/egHEtakw

    It makes no sense to waste effort building a 360° Customer View several times over with several tools. 🧐

    That's how Composable CDP were born!

    You already have a 360° view of your customer in your Data-Warehouse. Use it instead of duplicating your data again! Composable CDP are products built on top of your data-warehouse to activate its data to downstreams tools.


    But today, more and more products announce to be data-warehouse-connected 🔌.


    1️⃣ Salesforce is now connected to your data-warehouse
    2️⃣ Mixpanel is now connected to your data-warehouse


    Are Composable CDP dead 🧛?

    What do you think?
    I'd love to read your comments!

    A écouter sur la plage ou au bord de la piscine sans modération.

    Je retiens de cette discussion avec Christophe Blefari  et Pierre de Poulpiquet :


    1️⃣ L’autonomie peut amener au chaos si chacun fait des choses dans son coin, avec des données différentes, des définitions différentes, des outils différents.

    2️⃣ Il semble essentiel de structurer l’approche et de centraliser les données, les transformations, les définitions. Whaly ou dbt sont top pour cela. Des personnes doivent veiller au maintien de cohérence de l’ensemble et animer la communauté des utilisateurs.

    3️⃣ Des super-tables (peu de tables mais larges et très bien documentées) et super-dashboards (peu de dashboards de référence mais bien fournis) permettent de centraliser la connaissance et sont un excellent moyen de limiter les mauvaises interprétations et diminuer la complexité afin de rendre autonome. Toute nouvelle connaissance devrait se matérialiser dans ces assets. Les animateurs aident chacun à faire cela: ce n’est pas naturel de faire ce travail en plus après une analyse.

    4️⃣ Il y a plusieurs degrés d’autonomie. On peut aussi rendre les data analysts autonomes pour devenir indépendants des data engineers et activer eux mêmes les données.


    Merci Christophe Blefari et Pierre de Poulpiquet , j’ai passé un très bon moment et cela m’a pas mal inspiré.

    Bonnes vacances! 🏖️

    I love this very educational video from Richard Shenghua (升华) He which explains how a SQL query can export BigQuery data towards any other systems. 🤩


    It means you can now send BigQuery data directly from your dbt models or dbt post hooks ⚡:

    1️⃣ to a realtime database such as datastore for fast data serving

    BigQuery is perfect for massive calculations, but is not designed to obtain key-value data very quickly.

    And in the following use cases, you'd love to be able to retrieve quickly customer-profiles pre-computed in BigQuery:

    1️⃣  Content personalization 📄
    2️⃣  Real-time notifications 💬
    3️⃣  Embedded Analytics 📈
    4️⃣  Fraud-fighting 🐱‍👤


    Hopefully, El-Walid Ibrahim from Esmoz created a BigQuery function to export BigQuery data to Google Datastore which is specifically designed to obtain key-value data. 👀

    You can even use a dbt post-hook (as seen in the image) to sync your dbt model to Datastore automatically at `dbt run`  😲


    Actually, you don't event need dbt. It works in SQL ⚡.
    So it will also work in your dataform, sqlmesh, scheduled queries, etc.

    Just try this in your BigQuery 👇:
    -------------------------------------------------
    select bigfunctions.eu.export_to_datastore(
        'your-project',
        'your_namespace',
        'your_kind',
        'user1234',
        json '{"score": 0.99}'
    )

    When Axel Thevenot from Devoteam came to me and told me:
    👉 ❝ What if we had a function capable of executing any python code inside BigQuery? ❞

    I was like:
    1️⃣  Wow, this is potentially a game changer! 😲
    2️⃣  Yes, but it raises a ton of security concerns 😈


    Working together, we finally managed to create that function which enables anyone to execute arbitrary python code in BigQuery while keeping things secure (thanks to sandboxing). 🚀


    Try it! (it works without install):
    select bigfunctions.eu.run_python('return 1 + 1', null, null)

    Thanks to dbt post-hooks and the brand-new BigQuery function from  Shivam Singh, any BigQuery dbt model can now be uploaded to a Google Sheet at the moment it is updated. 👀


    Actually, you don't event need dbt. It works in SQL ⚡.

         '(select 1 as column1)',
          1000,

    Every BigQuery user can NOW ask questions over their data in English.

    The BigQuery function 'ask_my_data' converts your English question into SQL adapted to your data and execute it.

    To try it, simply execute the query written in first comment.
    (no install required!)


    ? How does it work?

    1️⃣ The function retrieves the table schema from INFORMATION_SCHEMA
    2️⃣ It asks a Google language model to generate the SQL code from your question and the table schema.
    3️⃣ It executes the generated query 🚀


    🐛 Does it always work?
    Probably not.
    Yet, I noted that if the names of your columns are self-explanatory, it works very often. And if it fails, the functions gives you details why and you can adjust your question.


    ➕ How can I get more info?
    -  BigFunctions is an open-source catalog of BigQuery functions.
    -  Read 'ask_my_data' doc: https://lnkd.in/ePp9pYiv


    ❤️ BigFunctions is fully Open-Source

    You want to generate PDF files from BigQuery to:

    1️⃣ Generate custom PDF reports with data
    2️⃣ Generate customized PDF files by client


    One good example is when you need to generate monthly pdf invoices based on client consumptions. 🧐


    You can now do this with one BigQuery query 👀
    Indeed, Guillaume Pivette from Neoxia created a function to convert html (built from user data) to pdf.  🙌


    The following query will:
    1️⃣ Get an invoice as html from internet
    2️⃣ Convert it to pdf
    3️⃣ Send it to YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS

    Just try it, you'll be amazed! 😲
    (it works in your own BigQuery without install)


    ---

    select 
      bigfunctions.eu.send_mail(
        'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS',
        'Email from BigQuery with PDF attached',
        '''
         BigQuery can send personalized emails!
        Your PDF is attached!
        ''',
        'invoice.pdf',
        (select 
          bigfunctions.eu.html2pdf(
            bigfunctions.eu.get(
              'https://lnkd.in/eQd7wvDX', null
            )
        ))
    )

    ---

    (in a real world example, you would not download the html through the internet of course, but build it in BigQuery from your customer data. You can check render_string bigfunction to help you with that).

    Google released new language models paLM2 this wednesday and I could not wait to add a bigquery integration. 😊

    👉 You can now run in BigQuery:
    select bigfunctions.eu.ask_bison('ANY QUESTION')  😲


    So asking it the question in the image, I learned two SQL things that I didn't know:
    1️⃣  We can compare timestamps with dates expressed in string.
    2️⃣  In `order by` clause we can put the alias of the computed aggregate


    Regardless of these tips, what amazed me the most was that I could improve my skills so easily. 👀

    I'd be very happy to read in comments how you think generative AI will help you.

    Did you know you can query any API from BigQuery 👀?



    By enabling data-practitioners to query data-sources without first moving the data to the data-warehouse, BigQuery has been a pioneer in Zero-ETL.

    You probably know that you can query data from bigtable, spanner, cloud sql, google sheets, files, etc using BigQuery interface. But did you know you can also query data from any API using BigQuery 👀??

    --------------------------------------------------
    select bigfunctions.eu.get('ANY_API_URL', null)
    --------------------------------------------------




    👀 Johan PROTIN from Zenika went further by creating a function to get latest exchange rates.
    Try it! 👇

    While working in a non-production environment you may want to generate fake data for testing purposes.

    Shivam Singh brought the great `faker` python library directly into BigQuery so that you can call it directly without install. 👀


    Just try the following query:

    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    select
      bigfunctions.eu.faker('first_name',   'it_IT')  as first_name,
      bigfunctions.eu.faker('last_name',     null)    as last_name,
      bigfunctions.eu.faker('email',         null)    as email,
      bigfunctions.eu.faker('address',       null)    as address,
      bigfunctions.eu.faker('date_of_birth', null)    as date_of_birth,
    from unnest(generate_array(1, 100))
    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


    You can also deploy the function in one-click in your own project. Follow the Readme in GitHub. 💡

    ELT has a drawback over ETL.

    As you get data without transform from your sources into you warehouse, (using fivetran, airbyte or any other modern-data-stack ingestion tool), your warehouse will contain personal data that you need to redact before exposing it to users.

    This new BigQuery function from Shivam Singh that you can call without install from your project may then help you 👀.

    When I launched bigfunctions, an open-source product to help data analysts not reinvent the wheel, I wasn't even sure it would get noticed.

    Today is a big milestone to me as we celebrate our 10th contributor.


    Thanks 🙏 Furcy Pin  sid ali sadi Benjamin Tabet  Thomas Lepine Jason Tragakis Jihene Cherif Tom Ellyatt Shivam Singh Anatole Callies


    Creating an open-source product is a great adventure. I advise you to go for it you’re hesitating. Or contribute to this one ☝️😁

    Felipe Hoffa inspired me for a long time by writing content about data-warehousing and in particular:
    👉 how to create functions on top of your data-warehouse to give super-powers to your data-analysts . 💥


    For instance:

    1. geolocate IP address: https://lnkd.in/gTPdqfAi

    2. send emails from your warehouse: https://lnkd.in/gFeTpuqk

    3. various functions including text fuzzy matching: https://lnkd.in/gXar3_ZP


    I'd even say it may have influenced me for my personal project:
    👉 create a catalog of open-source functions so that data-analysts stop reinventing the wheel 👉  bigfunctions.


    Thanks Felipe Hoffa for inspiring me.
    You again inspired me tonight and I deployed this new open-source bigquery function for time-series forecasting using prophet.

    Most transformations are now performed in SQL in the data warehouse. For specific needs such as parsing xml data, however, this can be tedious.

    🙏 Shivam Singh for bringing this xml2json function to the bigquery community who can use it directly, without install.

    Like some of us, I have dreamed of creating a product for a long time. But every time I wanted to get started, I found an excuse not to do it.

    Then I met Nacer Ibn Abdeljalil, the first Moroccan to successfully climb Everest and he gave me this advice:

    Make your Everest public. Tell your relatives about your goal. This will make your idea more real and commit you to your friends and colleagues.


    So I did. And soon after, the magic happened ✨. It was like I had already started. I then decided to make it real as a side-project.

    I created BigFunctions an open-source project to empower data-analysts and bigquery  users and keep them from reinventing the wheel. I already had a lot of positive feedback from the data-community and this is already a great achievement.

    👉 Make your Everest public


    🙏 To help me to reach my goal of 200 stars on GitHub and make this open-source side-project a success, I'd be really thankful if you can add a ⭐ on GitHub here: https://lnkd.in/emfVXKjJ

    BigFunctions website: https://lnkd.in/eBzr3wfM

    To help your data-analysis you may want to discretize continuous values into bins of equal width.

    1️⃣ You can then easily count how many values you have in each range and have a better understanding of your data. Hello histograms.

    2️⃣ It may improve your machine-learning algorithms as a preprocessing test.

    💥 sid ali sadi from Esmoz is bringing advanced json querying to any bigquery user through another open BigQuery function. 🧐

    He managed to embed JMESPath, a reknowned multi-programming-language library for advanced json-querying, inside a BigFunction. The result is outstanding! 💚

    I recently discovered the great 'sql-snippets' open-source repository from Taylor Brownlow from Count.

    I ❤️ the idea of sharing sql knowledge via open-source.

    👀 It inspired me to create some new BigQuery open-source functions callable from anyone without install from their project.

    Mateusz Klimek: I took the liberty of re-developing your `clean_additional_whitespaces` dbt macro as a public BigQuery function callable by anyone without install from their BigQuery project .

    To use it, simply call from your BigQuery console:
    ```
    select bigfunctions.us.remove_extra_whitespaces('Hello  \n   world!')
    ```
    You'll get ➜ 'Hello world!'

    What a pleasure to see Furcy brings the first Graph Algorithm to BigQuery as an open function callable by anyone without install.

    This connected components algorithm which detect communities in graphs is great for recommendation, fraud ring detections or data-explorations.

    Last week, a question was asked in our modern-data-stack slack-community: 
    "how do you get if a date is a public-holiday in your data-warehouse?"

    I realized this is a very common question. 

    Why should all data-teams implement their own implementation of such a basic function?

    Why not to have a common git repo where all data-teams would contribute to build a common library of useful functions callable from any BigQuery project for free?


    This is exactly one of the reason of existence of BigFunctions.
    👉 https://lnkd.in/eHQ-2spu

    If you like it, support it!
    - tell us in a comment what next BigFunction should be implemented
    - add a star in our GitHub repo. This helps us a LOT!
    👉 https://lnkd.in/emfVXKjJ
    - contribute to the repo y adding your own function.

    C'est important quand on commence un projet data de:
    - 👃 sentir les données, 
    - 👀 savoir s'il y a des outliers,
    - 🌊 connaître le nombre de null,
    - 📊 avoir une idée de la distribution ?
     
    C'est maintenant possible de faire le profiling des données directement dans la console BigQuery!
    (sans installation, sans avoir à télécharger de donnnées, sans faire de python, sans créer de compte de service ni filer l'accès à vos données à un tiers)

    Je viens de lancer un projet open-source pour cela

    - en rendant possible l’autonomie des data-analysts sur toute la chaîne: de l’ingestion des données à l’activation en passant par les transformations ou le déploiement de machine learning.
    - en apportant les bonnes pratiques de software engineering / Devops à la data
    - en créant un standard de la modern-data-stack permettant de connecter les données avec tous les services SAAS pour ingérer les données mais aussi pour les utiliser et générer des actions (envoi de notifications, personnalisation, etc).
