A use case for the `send_teams_adaptive_card` BigQuery function would be to send notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel upon the completion of a BigQuery job or when specific conditions are met in your data.

**Scenario 1: BigQuery Job Completion Notification:**

Imagine you have a long-running BigQuery query that aggregates daily sales data. You want to be notified in your team's channel when the job finishes.  You could create a scheduled query and then add a final step using the `send_teams_adaptive_card` function.  This step would execute only after the main query completes.

```sql
-- Your main query to calculate daily sales
SELECT ...
FROM ...

-- Send a Teams notification when the query is done
SELECT bigfunctions.us.send_teams_adaptive_card(
    "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL",
    "Daily Sales Update", -- title
    CONCAT("Daily sales data aggregation complete!  Total sales: $", SUM(daily_sales)), -- message
    "https://adaptivecards.io/content/adaptive-card-50.png" -- image_url (optional)
    "Click me!", -- button_text (optional)
    "https://www.bigfunctions.com" -- button_link (optional)
);
```

**Scenario 2: Anomaly Detection Alert:**

Suppose you're monitoring website traffic and want to be alerted if traffic drops below a certain threshold. You can set up a scheduled query to check the traffic data and use `send_teams_adaptive_card` to send an alert if an anomaly is detected.

```sql
-- Check for low website traffic
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN current_traffic < 1000 THEN bigfunctions.us.send_teams_adaptive_card(
                "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL",
                "ALERT", -- title
                "Website traffic is unusually low!", -- message
                "https://cdn-icons-png.freepik.com/512/5735/5735886.png" -- image_url (optional)
                "Check this out!", -- button_text (optional)
                "https://www.bigfunctions.com" -- button_link (optional)
            )
        ELSE CAST(NULL as STRING) -- Do nothing if traffic is normal
    END
FROM
  (SELECT COUNT(*) AS current_traffic FROM `your_project.your_dataset.website_traffic` WHERE timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR))
;
```

**Scenario 3: Data Validation Notification:**

You can use this function to notify your team about data quality issues. For example, if a data validation check fails, send a message to Teams.

```sql
-- Check for invalid records
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN invalid_records > 0 THEN bigfunctions.us.send_teams_adaptive_card(
            "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL",
            "Data validation failed!", -- title
            CONCAT("Found ", invalid_records, " invalid records."), -- message
            null, -- image_url (optional)
            null, -- button_text (optional)
            null -- button_link (optional)
        )
    ELSE CAST(NULL as STRING)
  END
FROM
  (SELECT COUNT(*) AS invalid_records FROM `your_project.your_dataset.your_table` WHERE some_validation_check IS FALSE);
```

These examples illustrate how `send_teams_adaptive_card` can integrate BigQuery with Microsoft Teams for real-time notifications, allowing for proactive monitoring and faster responses to critical events. Remember to replace `"YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"` with the actual webhook URL for your Teams channel and select the correct BigFunctions dataset based on your BigQuery region (e.g., `bigfunctions.eu`, `bigfunctions.asia_southeast1`).
